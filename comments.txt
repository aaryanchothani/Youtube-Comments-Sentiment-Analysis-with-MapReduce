0:13 I think it is just Java book but as Espanol 😅😅😅😅
0:18 there are 194 problems actually solved
Ets un puto geni. Ric molt amb tu.😂
Everywhere you are stuck then use Hashman 😅😅
hashmaps solve everything bra🤣
What are those cheat sheets....can someone send me
I have a new job starting tomorrow. I'm sure I will use HashMap from tomorrow.
hahahahaha <3 thanks, you just help me to stop and just trust my knowledge

I did literally everything apart from the paying for the chinese website since I applied to Canva and Atlassian as a tech lead from a scaleup. Studied all of the algorithm, data structure, and system design questions of the world in a week (I’m a uni dropout). Turned out I was just asked to build a simple game in vanilla js 😂
This is EXACTLY what happened to me a day ago. Because this is a big company I expect some kind of intense technical interview but I got some bs behavior questions instead. Fml
I WANT TO LEARN PROGRAMMING ,TEACH ME
Anddd.... its 100% me! Haha 😢

No, I will say not using Hashmap. If you have conflicts with your manager, just delete your manager and make yourself as the new manager.
😂😂 well played
Maybe programmers wouldn't overprepare if they weren't expected to write the entire source code for Skynet on a whiteboard then implement it with a machine they have built by hand with a box of loose transistors and thermal paste. Also whoever came up with Agile, project managers, and human resources should be regarded as worse than Hitler in the history books.
My interviewer asked me to define Capex and I regurgitated the formula for Net Working Capital. Oh wait, am I on the tech side of my YouTube recommendations again?
For those wondering, he's also terrible at Spanish.
I no longer agree to impromptu coding interviews. They're mostly full of trick questions designed to fail you. Your job candidacy should be based on projects that you have done. Tech interviews should be just basic questions to make sure you're not a complete imposter who watched one training series. A coding test should be a take home assignment only.
😂
Brilliant
Just laugh at your thumbnail
I thought it was going to be by getting a cs degree
1:09 😭😭😭😭😭🤣
0:44 🤣😭😭😭
OMG I laughed so hard 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂, I didn’t see that coming!!!
bruh I have a series of interviews today and was cramming on hash map collision handling strategies yesterday 🤣
Everyone has to go through this when you just start your job search 😂😂
Fucking love meditation😂
Been unemployed for three months and haven't taken THE interview because i don't feel prepared,...
This is timeless, I keep coming back to this for relaxation, best is the bathroom break 😂
Fucking love meditading hahahaha you made my day
Mapa hash puta madre! jajaja
That's a great fking answer to that questing though. I'm going to try to remembering that.
Check thier wife 😂😂😂
“You’re welcome” lol
FAANG companies or wannabe ones, are always doing the absolute most for a mid job with high risk of layoffs. They literally have strategies for flipping through people much like dell used to
The best way to prepare for any is to go unprepared.
Death note 😂😂
I've been unemployed for a while and I have a technical interview in two days and I'm freaking out. Thank you, after this video, I'm freaking out a little less.
"Breathing exercise" 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
how long is this guy going to prepare for job interviews
yeah his wife is nice
Isnt this better than not preparing
Hahaaaha
🤣😆🤣😆🤣😆🤣😆🤣😆🤣 hashmap to hash things out
that wife tho
This guy making me want to learn a Trade Skill. You know once a week aint so bad. Maybe more.
I took it seriously when you told about the number of problems you solved on leetcode, loved it :)
Can somebody tell me about the breathing exercise ? 😂😂😂
Don't understand shit, but memorized every keyword. Exactly the same here, and we programer never prepare for the coding interview, we prepare for a memorize contest.
Ese no era español
When did Stephen chow become a coder
Hashmap 😂😂😂😂😂
Google interview be like that thought straight to the technical questions lmao 🤣
“Breathing exercise”
you solved 1513 LC question but still ur rank is 107k  why dude? ☺
Peter Huang ?
why don't joma tech get into gaming, he has nothing else to do
try writing a browser extension for chrome
can u make something useful
halarious
Someone please share those "sketchy Chinese websites" 👀
literally all possible wrong moves a interviewee can take. lol
Lol no such thing as overpreparing for a swe interview
Hey, I watched your clip over twenty times and I am still laughing. Thank you. :)
Literally my life past few months. Tech interviews are soul crushing. Not the interviews themselves but the anxiety before them 😢
The bvathroom breathing exercise seems to be quite a popular thing.
😂 that was great.
"You're welcome."
hmmmmm nice
Its so absurd that its actually becoming reality
I f*cking love meditating😂
I have been a programmer for 15 years now and worked for Fortune 100 companies. My salary is $200K with benefits/bonus. I never needed to use any of the design patterns I learned in school. I strongly believe that FAANG style interview is not suitable for 99% of the companies out there. To give you an analogy, FAANG style interview is geared towards finding a good Heart Surgeon in SDE world. But if the company/position needs a nurse for their WordPress site, why waste time/money doing FAANG style interview? Sorry for those who struggle through FAANG interviews and get only $135K job offers; only to get laid off after a year. It's a shame.
What is hashmap?
I feel called out
I will never have any interview unfortunately, so I don't have to worry with that. Another channel to add to the list "don't recommend this channel" (anyway the guy doesn't need my view, he's certainly senior dev of the year earning 7 or 8 figures per year because he is an expert for 40 years and know all programming langages, plus when they have all that money they can have a yt channel to earn more figures). I'm the opposite, I don't have money so I can't earn money
Basically
Sad but true
You need to read books because it will instill creativity in your mind and problem solving mentality because stories will improve your critical thinking. If you memorize, it's a big problem because you are copying other people work without any invention to new ideas, which AI would easily take your role. You need to think like Ceo and business owner like how you would improve the business of the company. You need to use "critical thinking" this is the most crucial thing for you
My man, I am watching this content 15 mins before my final tech interview for a programmer position... not the first but I am still nervous as I was the first time, almost 10 years ago. I must admit your video made me laugh and release some tension... Well... finger crossed!
0:38 what are those sketchy Chinese sites does anyone know ?
It a result of the breathing exercises!
man this is PRICELESS - love it.
First question: softskills... xddddddddddd
This video always refreshes me before attending any tech giant interview 😂
What do you do?
Your wife!!!!
Can’t stop laughing cause this is so true
So relatable
It's a really helpful video for me, because I'm dreaming of becoming a programmer 10901
Hashmap！
what for? to be randomly fired after overworking??
hashmap hashmap
Memorizing the LC answers is the most stupid thing to do. It's not programming anyway, it's blind replication of popular patterns, which is nowhere near writing efficient code. But unfortunately many interviewers are also pattern-minded.
#lol - that's just awesome right there...  0:57   hahahaahahahaha
haha HASHMAP
❤❤❤
im a Software engineer and I won't understand this new trend to work with 4-5 screens. 2 are enough, and we are not stock market brokers
太鸡巴好笑了，真的
haha HashMap
"Mapa hash, puta madre" hits hard as a trilingual person: Spanish, English and JavaScript
me, right now
the bathroom one is the most important
“Hashmap motherf*cker” LMAO 💀💀💀
people here are extremely serious that they overarch the humorous part of the video 😅

Yup hashmap can be real helpful u know😂
That's how I know you're a fellow caine user such as myself. You're in your own house yet still go to the washroom to partake. so jokes
Check their wife
Python,c, Spanish 😂
Hashmap that was the great answer
♥
You can use a hashmap to keep track of all the things that make your boss mad.
Oh please joma, contiue to make such content 😅❤
If you have conflict with your manager, you resolve that collision by looking up another team using chaining, linear or quadratic probing 😂. So hashmap is the answer to find a new collision free team
一亩三分地哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈
I freaked out and was so nervous for my first interview and they only asked me 4 questions about python and sql lol, but its very entry level though
It’s mediating or METHeating?
i knew i should've made breathing exercises before my interview
Does not make sense to prepare, AI is way too strong
mr robot giving interview
hashmap mf was good :D can relate rofl
It's true. I say "hash map" to solve everything thing.
Soooo me 😅
Lollll
😂😂😂
so true!!!
هاك عوود🛰🔷️
Practise 1000 questions and prep the interview for a month and still doing get the job because someone decided to raise a digit or interest rate
The Chinese reading trick is amazing 😂
Literally me 😂
Did he really solve 1513 problems? 😟
Breathing exercise... hell yeah. ☺
Programmer Interviews are the hardest interviews in the World, they make it impossible for an average person
Anyone know these Chinese websites is talking about where you get leaked interview questions ? 😂
🤣🤣
What is that website for training? Is it for java?
🤣🤣🤣
You work for 40yrs to have $1M in your
retirement, meanwhile some people are putting just $10K in a meme coin from just few months ago and now they are multimillionaires.......
Haha overthinking is the skill of programmer 😂
Nice
😂
The way he reads CTCI 😂
hahaha , true
Interviewer: What would you do if you had a conflict with you manager?
Joma: Hashmap! I'll use the hasmmap!
Interviewer: Hash, hash... What, you eat too much hash-brown? You brain turned into potato.
facts
Why this video is 5 hours long?
Fucking love meditating ❄️❄️
Got a junior js(react/in house forked version of typescript) position position on September 2023, after I got by bachelor's degree in compsci. Had 3 friends that were already working at the company I was applying at, so I knew that the interview was hard.
It was a 3 stage, with the final stage being somewhat of an exam(uni exam format)
So I knew I had to overprepare, first 2 stages(initial frirst interview with personal questions with a bit of theory, then the second one where I had to do a small prpject, all were from home). Then the final, the so called "exam" at the company, where they gave 4 tasks, 2 algo tasks, 2 were web-programming). 
Since I couldn't look anything up, barely passed the final stage. 
So yeah, depends on the company you are applying to, whether you are overpreparing or not 😂
I had an interview prep with with Abigail Hoeh. Her YT channel is Work Life Balance. I did well on all the soft questions with advices provided by her. Highly recommend!
He simply did overfit on the training set.
That's all
Me sorprendí cuando escuché esa palabra en español terriblemente pronunciada xD
Thanks for sharing your expertise! Cool content.
Breathing exercise was good😂
Como se o chat GPT não existisse.... 💀
Hahaha this is just too good
You'll not pass the hiring manager anyway.
Dude, this is hilarious!
The cheat sheet scene is the best, reminds me the Coding Interview Champ app that solves the coding problem in real-time.
Meanwhile me naming my name as 'hired'

Interviewer: hey, so You're hired? 
Me : Thanks
epic for all times 😁
LOL
Посмотрел повторно, всё равно смешно. Такая уж наша айтишекчка)
Nice wife ❤
Obviously you are paid 5 times more than traditional industries like manufacturing and banking so you deserve that pressure
No such thing as over preparing
You should start by paying for the questions before everything else
Lol
question should've been how to center a div😂
🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶
"Hm, nice."

💀💀💀
God, thanks i'm not a programmer
deep breathing exercise got me 🤣🤣🤣🤣
why programmers are the onlyones who get test interviews?
Hashmap ill use the haspmap 😂😂😂😂
I answered hashmap too and got my job. Ty yoma
what is the wife's insta? i need to prepare for an interview too
"Hashmap, i will use Hashmap"
I literally had a job interview several months ago where the CEO told me that I should 'burn with passionate desire' for the job position.
Who got excited about beat rate of Leetcode😂
old but god
This is so funny.
I go the my bathroom for my breathing exercise😆🤭
I'm enlightened by the depth of this content. A book with related material transformed my way of thinking. "The Hidden Empire: Inside the Private Worlds of Elite CEOs" by Adam Skylight
Remember, if you don't know what to do.... throw a hash map at it
I don't prepare for interviews. I just show up and say "I don't know." and "It depends" a lot. I always get an offer.
it’s like you have solved all hard leetcode problems… but on the interview they asked the easy ones 😂😂😂😂
😂😂😂😂😂😂
Dynamic programming! A binary tree!
I am watching this while over preparing for my job interview bc I watched one comedic skit on what a guy would do if he was asked a coding question he didn’t know. The question was a Machine Learning question, and I was stupid enough to take the skit seriously. 😂
0:28 Leena Xu
I am doing this right now.. preparing for my SQL interview... LOL
Damn ,this happened to me yesterday
1513 leetcode problems but your rank 175k lmao nice inspect element
I effing love meditating <3
"Meth-diate"💀
Your welcome.- best tone ever
I just finished my first week of work as a Software dev. The interview consisted of 3 things: Object Oriented Theory, Databases and Workflow. 

What I did this past week: Make Flowcharts for 3 step Requirements and Use Cases workflows
hahhahahahhha! :D
Bro why is this so accurate 🤣😭
Bro is low-key Eliot from Mr robot 🤖
Obviously more social one
Hashmap! I would use a hashmap! gold...
I need to work in a different industry
Sweet Mary and Joseph. I did 95% of the above mentioned (did not check interviewers wife), even read the same books, and it was the first and most serious question of the interview that got me the job. What. The. F....
Now programmers are out of jobs. Thanks ai for programming better than any programmer
that's about right, lol
散列表对付上司是吧，在下佩服
Solution to every problem - HashMap
0:09 is that death-note next to the book your grabing .wtf.
Hi
😂😂
An actual question. When you prepare cheat sheets, wouldn't the interviewer notice when you look away and start reading for a couple of seconds. How do you guys do it. I never used a cheat sheet in my interviews.
Amazing
What’s the platform he’s using at the beginning?
Shit, I laugh every time when he says you're welcome....
LMAO is that instagram doublelift and leena?
Dude spent more time checking the wife than researching anything else
It’s so funny 😂 thank you for this
Ahah 😂 I love it
All of that in 1 minute ... How can ?
Lol. Excellent video. Very funny
The #map anwser for ever Thing XD
I declare this as probably the best tech video on youtube 🤣🤣
Fucking hilarious! YOU'RE WELCOME!
On the flip side, the one time I interviewed for a C++ developer, I couldn't answer any of the questions. I had been 99% self-taught, so therefore despite having programmed for ~15 years including multi-threading and networking code, I had absolutely no idea what "static" meant beyond needing it occasionally to make the compiler happy.
Bro can you explain me whats that on 0.28 🥵
Talk about being an overachiever Jonna.
Good brother
that means you have to focus on soft skills as much as the technical skills
Bro, gonna store manager and his arguments in  key : value pair
Dude, Literally i used to that
All i do is remembering big codes, try to solve as many as problems, And all they asked me is - how to find a prime number 😂
In other words, he would sort out the problem with manager
Can you come up with O(1) space complexity? 😊
As someone whose first language is Spanish that caught me off-guard and made me laugh so hard, I woke up my brother
what's the chinese website? (asking for a friend)
i've been working as a freelancer last 4 years on Django and Express and Laravel even i have lotsof project with Phoenix  Elexir which its really hard i mean really f.. hard but this days i thought hey mybe its not that bad if i can get hired and go like to europe and i realized i know nothing like Jhon Snow ... God please help me get my first job after this years ...
I love meditation 😂
All I’ll say is that being over-prepared is still better than being unprepared
I'm not even under prepared bruh!
Can you please name me the background music
Mapahash
what is his breathing exercise?
i love @Joma Tech, the info he gives in such a fun way and the plot twist of hashmap lmao
at the end of interview make me drop the coffee cup for laugh
This is so true we do the same 😂😂😂
Hashmap is indeed the correct answer!
THAT'S SO FKING ACCURATE. OVERPREPARING JUST GAVE ME ANXIETY AND SELF-BLAME FOR NOT BEING GOOD ENOUGH IN INTERVIEWS OR AROUND GIRLS.
0:10 so....Programmers have a death note just in case nothing goes according to plan?....Interesting XD
"thank you for hopping on this interview"

"you're welcome"
this is my cheat video to crack interviews & i crack interviews & i feel SMART
How can you be so funny omg I can't I am dead LOLLLL
Just throw a hashmap at every problem, using a hashmap can never be wrong, hashmaps are always the correct answer to every question, forever.
Hi, everyone, how to prepare any programming language either through pdf file or written notes.
Mapa Hash, pta madre :v

Bien ahí, shinito :v
Took- stuck on a problem? throw hashmap... too literally xD
Can you explain in BigO notation how quickly you'd solve conflicts with your manager?
"Mapa Hash, ptm" xD
Never prepared for any interviews. I was hired for more than 90% of the jobs. ¯⁠\⁠_⁠(⁠ツ⁠)⁠_⁠/⁠¯
Я думал это Брюс Ли.А это безработный программист😅
You are simply Amazing !!!
I never prepare for an interview, I think a good state of mind benefits me much more considering I have a good memory. (I do pass most of them, I think the calm I’m radiating is much more important than being able to solve 100% of the problem)
The end did it
0:47 "FUCKIN' LOVE MEDITATING"! 😂♥️🤣🤟
After winning the kung fu football match stephen chow has now started a youtube channel......Cool.
Xd hashmap could be a great solution for that
oh no, he forgot the solf skills!!! lol
BREATHING EXERCISE XD
Tell me the secret of your healthy eyes
Im more interested about the wife
missed your video like this
Have to do this for real now to get a job
spanish being a programming language:
to be fair, programmers do this and still need to take 100 applications because no one accepts it. Therefore it's really not overpreparing.......
lmaooooooooooo
so many good advices in 1 minute! :D
Wow what a perfect video, instant sub
edit. watched it second time and still cant believe how good the acting, writing, narrating and pacing was lol
The way he said, "You're welcome". Everyone needs that kind of confidence.
Lmao "youre welcome..." 
Strong start
I will use ConcurrentHashMap
fr though its always a hashmap
i'd use hashmap too
Too true. You grind for a year straight just to get a "Hey can you uh idk reverse this string BUT capitalize every other letter? Bonus question: Add an exclamation point to the end of the string!"
"For my breathing exercise"....yeah right😜
i m chemist and i had an interview last month. I prepared myself for this and repeated reactions, laws you know, some language practices..
Interview started and first question was "do you have a relative living in Istanbul?" 
I said "What?, no...."
00:13 this is gold!
that's me
By this video I googled and learned hashmap
A good programmer is not a stupid guy who learn like a crazy. Its a dog who does. The good coder is someone who knows where and how to create the solution. That guy learning like a crazy is a monkey.
😂😂😂😂
Hahaa as a fresher with no degree im still struggling to get a job , even tno i work hard
Dude is more of CEO and founder materials
Hahahahahah  epic!
hahaha  Im you in this video right now! Lol
Kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk
I'm not a programmer but these videos still amuse me XD
Most people could find this reply funny, though it's actually perfect. 
Interviewer would be confused and ask how or why this would be the solution. Then you answer something like "think about it...at some point you will see". It works even better when answering with self invented, confusing, weird sayings instead of hashmap
🤣🤣HASHMAP!! I WILL USE A HASHMAP!! THAT PART MY GOSH😂😂🤣😂😆🤣🤣
hashmap rules the world
joma the content inventor
ahahah epic
❤
yeah but does your programming language of choice hashmap HashDoS resistant or not
This is so relatable it's disturbing haha. I did most of the things he said.
0:28 wait isn't she Leena Xu?
what is the first webpage with the problems ?
What name software in the first clip
I've never seen that much stuff in a minute as I did then.
so fucking nice! lol
What is the web site that appears at the beginning of programming problems?
*Beats 99 % in all leetcode problems*
Ah yes, breathing exercise.
Dude you were so close. The answer was double ended queue. Get it together! Hashmap... psht
0:09 Death Note + Attack on Titan is very vital for every interview^^
lol 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 bro you just killed me
Employer: So what skills and programs are you fluent in?

Interviewee: C++, Python, Java and 8 ball! 🤩🤪🥴

Employer: ….ok….😳.  Before you start, you have to pass a drug test.

Interviewee: 😔

Man no one knows doublelift/leena hahaha
I love it, great work! Very Mr. Robot
0:44  breathing exercise  😅😅😅😅🤣🤣
that the dumbbbbbbbbbest i ever see in my life when someone goes to interview🤪😝😝😝
Because the Bully Narcissistic Manager is more important then YOU ... and they want to know in advance if you are already OBEDIENT or not, otherwise they must to destroy your SPIRIT... and if they were not able to put you down,  they will call you difficult and crazy and they will build a case with you as the problem .... THAT'S WHY THEY PUT THIS QUESTION IN THE INTERVIEW ... ah, yes ... you are the best programmer and the best candidate from technical point of view, SO WHAT? ...  "SOFT SKILLS" ARE MORE IMPORTANT,in special THE OBEDIENCE
So goooooodddd 🤣
Breathing exercise 🤓🤓
I am confused why anybody this smart and focused would want to be an employee. This is more work than it takes to start a business.
what's the song name do you use?
I use a hashmap to look up why he's wrong!
omg lol, i just randomly said hashmap in my last fucking interview and got my rejection yesterday lol
Breath excises very helpful.
anyone knw who the wife is
Your monitors rock. Js
Mapa Hash Put...Madre 🤣🤣🤣🤣 Bilingual Programmer as It's Finest !
question: Which Animal Would You Be?   answer: hashmap!
Yeah, kinda did this. 

I had an interview for a junior dev op position in one of the biggest tech company of my country.

I prepared my interview for an entire week, learning their tech stack and how to build efficient CI/CD, artifacts management and monitoring on it.

At the interview, that was just like 15min, they just asked me very very basic question about the philosophy of dev ops.  I was underwhelmed.

I got the job and learned later that they didn't expected much technical knowledge from a junior position, only a bit of theory and human behaviour.

Yup.
I would definitely use the hashmap.
0:13 MAPA HASH PUTAMADRE! lmao
I watched this video on repeat instead of "meditating". Worked out great - I join Google next week as their  AI/ML architect. Thanks Joma 🙌
Most replayed instant being his wife's picture in bikini. "Soft" Engineers.
HASHMAP
ending XD
What’s the website he used for the problems
if you solved 1513 questions in leetcode as Jonathan , how come your rank still shows 175887,   you would be under 10k
AM I THE ONLY ONE THAT IS GOING TO COMMENT ON HIS 1513 SOLVED PROBLEMS?!
lol !!
hm, nice
“Mapahash putamadre” 😂😂
You’ll be asked for stuff you’ll actually never use. In my 25 year career I never had to choose between linked list vs array list or optimise garbage collection. But I had to do much other very difficult, non-coding stuff. Actually, as a senior, I spent 95% of time in “what to code” than “how to code”
up主能看懂中文？
Better to be a warrior in a garden, than a gardener in war.
2022: it's overpreparation
2023: that's far from enough
when you solve 1513 questions on leetcode and your Rank is still 175,887
i would try to build graph and try to remove the minimum edge to make  graph a acyclic to remove conflict.
bro in that situation i would probably use JavaScript
HashMap, I will use HashMap... this was insane.
Mapa hash putaumadreu
learning spanish so true xD one time i was working on a spanish program i was literally learning a whole new language and im now pretty fluent with many words
Software engineer here!

I have no idea what a hashmap is. All I do is write documents.
Mapa hash, puta madre! 
LOL
Preparing for interview tomorrow and this is GOLD!!!
conflict -> HashMap
I think nowadays technical knowledge and skill are taken for granted. Being able to complex solve problems in code is an expectation, not a plus.
Honestly, I think what the big tech companies really want are team players.

With the popularity of the CS major in college these days, lot of today’s new grads are very technically capable and ambitious, but tend to be lone wolf and solitary, preferring to work alone and stay out of groups and discussion.
In school that’s fine, but the company wants people who can compromise, understand and resolve conflict when *people* in the room don’t agree. The want people who can bring a room full of discordant minds together and make something bigger than the sum of its parts.
I hardly understood the spanish words "mapahash, puta madre" 😂
I was looking for the serious interview and landed here.
a sketchy Chinese website lol🤣
hashmap works everywhere but have you tried array
This is not only funny but quite usefull too
this one was actually hilarious
😂😂😂😂😂😂
This is a fact lol
Is glass door genuine?
Joma te amo putamadrrre
And the conflicts resolved. Hence hashmap works everywhere.
Better overprepared than underprepared 😄
Hashmap?😂😂😂😂😂
Amazing. Loved it. 😂
LOL oh, ma GOD! 🤣Thx, Joma!🙏
Havent laughed so hard in a while =)))
wtf i died lmao XD
No bullshit question like what do you know about our company 🤩
ONLINE INTERVIEW ftw
This is literally what I just went through 😂
lol breathing exorcise
Felt identified ... learning all of that SCRUM jargon is a MUST !
This was fu**ing amazing. Lol
Just like my interveiw. Not kidding!
Like the way he did this funny video. Special!!
That answer is golden
@john tech  please I need an API that detects cash that enters a dollar account
Hahahahaha es real, me pasó en una entrevista xD y siempre la respuesta es hashmap xD
I am preparing for my interview in the next one month, that is exact what i do.
You're welcome
_"Mapa hash puta madre"_ 😂😂
Is that Peter Huang from Healthtech 1?
Your breathing exercises are suspects 🤨🧐
0:04 - 1513 wow
Thanks for this. I'm nervous about am upcoming interview and needed a good laugh 😆
10/10 for Creativity.
most interviews are useless
0:42 much like cocaine break lol
Puta madre is just like fuck hijo de puta o hijo puta would be the correct translation
What website does he use for the questions??
How to ace life
If anyone know what kind of screens and supports he used for them, and would like to share with me, that would be great
Mapa hash puta madre 🤣🤣🤣🤣
"You're welcome "
mapa hash, puta madre 🔥
I'll use a hashmap you puta madre jajaja
0:42 he has good bathroom to do coke in
did you really solve 1513 leetcode problems? WoW 🤓
HasmapO(1) XD
The End 🤣🤣
As a native spanish-speaker, I died at 0:13
hhahaha，sketchy Chinese website........🤣
Mapahash puta madre 🤣🤣
hahahahah, using hashmap if there're conflicts with your manager!
You left the bathroom light on
🤣🤣🤣
Me cagué de risa, tomé su like buen señor
usually i just beat the crap out of him. simpel
Wrong answer, always have to use lambda one liner.
😭😭😭😂😂😂
That’s so me right now 😂😂😂
Mapahash puta madre

Lol 0:29 I literally do this 😂😂
More like how programmers prepare for online exams
"Don't understand shit but memorized every keyword" sums up most of my job interview preparations
Who couldn't use some coke from time to time 😍
Every thing is good but it not recracking its cracking.
LMFAO FROM SWEDEN STOCKHOLM 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
name of the music?
Mr Robot leak?
I'm not a programmer but I prepare for an interview in a similar way. In the end the question that makes me puzzled is "tell something about yourself"
🤣🤣🤣👍👍👍

hashmap does resolve conflict to get around constraints of its internal working but does not resolve conflict that resides outside its internal working. this was very funny :D
I recognized you! You work in "Slow horses"
0:13 “¡Mapa hash, p**a madre!”
0:27 Leena? Doublelift? Wtf?
😂😂😂
what's the website he used to solve problems.
Basic books for python and R?
Yes, use hashmap.
cool short video
Thanks bro! 🙂 As someone working hard to succeed in the industry, I appreciate people who share this kind of knowledge.
Remember being rejected because of the way i was answering the questions. I got overprepared and literally knew all the answers. Answers were too structured and interviewer suspected that I don't understand what I was saying. No, I did. (It was an internship interview, so questions were easy and I can accept why they were sus about me)
Just to be fired in the next Lay off…. Hahahahaha
Nah the ending gets me everytime🤣
Interviewer : What will you do if you're hungry??
Me after watching this video : Hashmap. I'll use Hashmap
I learned a lot here and it was funny hahah
This reads like a 4chan greentext
today this exactly happens to me :D instead they asked me "tell me about yourself". well hashmap does not seems like an answer for this question so i chose recursion and DFS. they told me they will call me in a week or so.. :) damn i feel so proud of myself cannot wait to reponse :) :D :D :D :D
Buen español jaja
The UML diagram though.
He should have said hash map in Spanish 😅.
0:11-You forgot the JAVA!
Lol
I would also use a hash map
Company: How did you find us?
Me: Binary Search.
Kkkkkkkkkkkk muito boom
what OS is he using?
This video literally sums it all, how insanely difficulty interview could get and the preparations required! Can't stop repeating and ROFL at 0:14, feel so badS cool!
You prefer coffee with milk or not?
I would use hashmap without the map
I'd never cheat or prepare like this. you are making fool of yourself. Anyways, good luck for making money though on youtube
I wish some people prepared for my interviews.. their CV’s say 8/10 python skills. But they cant even give me a simple answer like whats the difference between a tuple and a list…
Doublelift 👀
I'm spanish and i died with the "mapa hash p*ta madre"
You guys prepare?
一亩三分地 lol
this man is obsessed with hashmap 😂
Why do you have to swear in videos which kids view. I mean you can still create videos without this sort of stuff. It's disappointing and I hope that you can create content excluding this language.
So funny, but so real 😄
I'm the only one that is underprepared?
I threw up when he said "I'll use the hashmap" 🤣
AJAJAJA mapa hash putamadre x,DDD you nailed it
😂😂😂
The best interview prep video I've seen TBH
This is so funny from 0:16 till 0:27 check their wife oo nice ...
Mapa hash puta madre 🤣🤣👏👏
You don’t prepare for interview. You do 100 interviews to prepare for The Interview
Awesome!!!!! I'm going through the same thing
Hey - it's not okay to make sexist comments about checking out people's wives. This is why women get pushed out of tech. Thanks for taking on board the feedback and hope you'll contribute positively towards inclusion in tech in the future.
Dobre, kurwa.
Thank you Plumber for coming to my house to fix my toilet, but before I let you in, I need to ask you a few questions to see if you're the right fit. First, can you tell me a short story, and how that story fits in to the values of this household?
😂😂😂😂 this is too real
I've got my bubble-sort whiteboard psuedocode code routine down to 18 seconds.
jajajajaja me mato cuando tiro en español, hashmpa puta madre jaja
The annoying thing is after years of development experience and a masters degree... People still want to test whether I can code.🤷
what is the name of your monitor?
This happened to me exactly. I was so pissed off
No, they nake you do "test" often before even first i-view, often requiring more than 20h of work - of course for free, don't u even dare to ask if they pay u anything! 
After spending 8h on calls theyll decide you don't fit their "culture" because u play other games than them and dump you on last, fifth stage.
True story.
Phuck them...
Phuk them all to death!
Oh and don't get me started on their arrogance....
the interviewer stalking was on point
I wish one candidate I interview would do half of this.
I would used a hashmap to loop the manager and find out the problem and use the hashmap agin to slove it
NSA bros, I dont wanna repeat myself over and over. My HS classmate Caleb Lin went to MIT now he is making English and Math teaching apps in Pasadena. I am not interested in becoming American or working in IT. Thank you
I will use HOOK  up with him to channge his STATE of mind  or find another ROUTE of action till he or she REACT differently 😂
Hashmap putamadre
;))
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
oh God this breathing thing killed me
cool
If my manager was female, I'll probably try brute force.
*Typing INTENSIFIES*
Yo! Master Joma make vids of Chatgpt 😁
funnion
HashMap is not a thread-safe, so, how can it help to safely resolve a conflict?
How much content this guy can put in one minute is just mind blowing. Love you joma
Hahaha
It was legendary 🤣🤣😂😂😂😂😂
Check there wife (noted).
I'm going to try this one this one is new for me.
Software engineer that was doing management job for the past 15 years: I always make my interviewer spoke first …about them and their work. Help me size the person and their team immediate needs.
What is a good camera to shoot YouTube videos? And I love your videos!
Joma your are really awesome and unique. Can't stop laughing.
which os do you use?
I memorize the code in all 3 languages, phython, c++ and spanish. 🤣🤣 too hilarious. For me.
I also memorize all main process flows and functions of ERP in all 3 platforms, Microsoft, SAP, and Salesforce.
I also bring up the cheatsheets. 🤣🤣🤣
😂😂😂😂😂
so how is your communication skills 
me: [i] += "will" "use" [a] {("hashmap")}
btw i dont know coding but its exciting
The Spanish had a Chinese accent. I was expecting and American accent, hahaha!
Why is this actually true haha! my very first interview for an internship went exactly like this. I had practiced some questions from the 50 most common asked questions for coding interviews and what not only to not be asked almost anything about coding but these
Loved this video! Would it be possible to ask what was the background sound effects of time ticking away?
The breathing exercise was so efficient.
hahaha
I thought that guy is Stephen Chow
So, you work for Microsoft and Maria started after you????
“How pronounce sql”
Some companies do antidoping
it has been years when the last time I got a job relevant interview as FE engineer, most of the time i get interviewed by ppl less experienced than me and they are looking for weird shit not related to the actual job, it's like all they want is a weirdo focused on extreme edge cases
How does this guy know me so well? 😂😂😂
It's O(1) tho. Quick conflict resolution
I probably should try that breathing exercise, not for an interview but before the exams :>
fr. it’s always a hashmap.
wkwkwkkw from Indonesian
😂use the hasmap
hahaahahhaahhaahhaah
Me in college wait there interview code questions ffffffuuuuuuuuuuuuuck
I refuse to accept that he didn't say 0:13 to respond to the question the interviewer asked.
jajajajajajajajajaja
Sigh, you can't use an hashmap to solve conflicts with the boss...
"Mapa Hash puta madre" 😂😂😂
XD
I’m not an expert ...
But watching and analyzing the video from beginning to end, I can not say anything because as I said at the beginning, I'm not an expert...
My first thought was: Stephen Chow has a new career...
Lmfao 🤣
what's the site at the beginning?
What webste are u using at 0:03 ? Anyone ?
Was that breathing exercise or something dank 🙄🙄related to his wife 😂😂😁
Hmm nice
hahahah You have to subscribe to this channel 🤣🤣😂😂🤣
first, i will solve all of the problems in leetcode, second, i will learn every programming language, third, i will learn entire math in the world, and the final one, prepare.
마지막에 빵터졌네 ㅋㅋㅋㅋ lol
I’m not even a coder. I’m all physics and engineering but these videos are so well made and funny 😆
Nooo i wanted more in this video 😂
Fucking love mediating.
So your interviewer is double lift 😆
"Breathing exercise"...
Sure! 🤣
Lol what a joyride this video is...
😅😅😅
Literally me, right now - ps, can I get those cheat sheets ? Please ?
No dude..the keyword is conflict
So you need to solve the conflict first, then merge with your manager again
You are all laughing but hashmaps are great at conflict resolution with management.
when you overprepare and all they ask is culture fit questions
I can't with the "you're welcome" 💀💀💀💀
HashMap is usually the best first try on any question ... Great Job!
1:07 he is not wrong
I have an interview tomorrow and I pray to the gods that I don't do this.
man, I'm dyeing LMAO
Mapa hash putamadre
lol the Doublelift's gf 💀
Man, I think your videos are becoming better and better every time. I've sent this one to all of my juniors. Becoming cool in my team because of your videos. When I write "LGTM" they wonder what does it mean, therefore I can socialize with gen-z easily :) I recently found out it is used on google internal code reviews. Thanks for providing cool things.
🤣
😆😆😆
一亩三分地😂
“I love meditating”! Everything is happening so fast this has to be the most under appreciated line on the internet
This is just brilliant! 😂
Jajaja mapa hash put*madre jajajaj lo amo!
LOOOL
I can totally relate to that
3. 3 Psyduck plushies on the couch. The video is suddenly more likable, but more psyducks please. 🦆🔮🦆🔮🦆🔮🦆🔮
is that leena xu LOL
I died at "I love meditating"  but the "You're welcome" probably made me pee a little
Yes, hashmap solves everything... LOL.
LMAO Doublelift and Leena
This video never gets old 😂

Mapa hash putamadre raaaaaaaa!!!
i would not mind to put all managers in a hash map
I'm not even applying to FAANG but have to go through this anyway 🙄Without the meditating part, btw
You forgot to name the Leetcode
Didn’t expect the ending. LMAO
Kkkkkkkkkkkkk very funny!
I solved 40 leetcode by copying others. Genuinely solved 4-5 😂😂 by my own.
That's right! Hashmap
One content, two languages. What I have now written may have a perfect mirror in another language.!!!!!!!!!!
Legit
00:56 😂
🤣🤣hashmap
Everyone wants MAANG job
video reminds me of old ryan higa content
I'm no longer able to use hash maps without thinking about this video and cracking up, ty 😂
😂😂😂😂
Very funny! Can relate to every second of this video! One more to add: Meetapro for mock interviews!
Fukin love meditatin
Yep, and in my interview yesterday, the first thing I told the interviewer was that I would use a hashmap, because it would always work. Except, he said they are unordered.
OH MY GOD im laughing out loud
Danm I'm so smart😁
LMAO 🤣😂
when he says HASHMAP, he looks like that one guy in Yakuza 0
😂😂😂😅😅😅
The “wife” is Leena Xu, your welcome.
😆😆 breathing exercises 😶‍🌫️
Memorized the wrong sharding and they didnt like the smell
Man I wish I was as cute as the interviewers wife
This is one of my favorites videos in Youtube 😂😂😂😂😂
Avoid cursing
Can solve a leetcode hard, needs stack overflow to center a div
😂😂😂😂
Жиза
Omg this is so true
That 1point3acres line cracked me up LOL (they're really expensive)
0:09
I appreciate that Death Note over there
why is this so accurate lmfao
i like you so much/🦔🦔🦔🦔🦔🦔🦔🦔🦔
Instead you can use "Quick Sort" 😀😀
Damn, I wasn't expecting that ending
"Dont understand shit but memorise every keyword" 💀🤣
00:09  The Death Note🫣🫣
I love the "speed-read" bit at the beginning.
I love it for how useless it is 😂
I would include a hash map and binary tree and iterate the map multiple time and...

Wait..what's the question??
Mapahash puta madre. LMAO
If you ever get stuck, throw the hashmap at the problem
This is so funny.
this is fucking hilarious
What is the name of the sketchy Chinese website? It's hard to see.
the Maphash, motherfucker translation cant be more wrong and funny at the same time haha you made my day
It’s the quite serious “You’re welcome” for me
what is this sketchy Chinese website? :)
Joma, there is someone stole your video, 
https://youtube.com/shorts/tzJIrRiW2pA?feature=share 😁😁, he just translated it into russian))
He's so obsessed with hash map uh
LMAO THAT'S DOUBLELIFT'S GF
gain subsciber!
Would be fun if he was an interviewer himself. :D
😂😂hashmap
Given that I am currently in the process of job seeking in this field, this gives me severe anxiety.
Fu*kin love meditating 💀
Hashmap is the right answer.

Key: "Conflict with manager".
Value: "Kill the motherfucker, take his jerb."
True story
Yoooho relax ur beans dude
Hmmm… nice 😊
This episode is absolutely classic!😄
Mapa Hash, puta madre 😂
Fuckin' love meditating 💀
i thought the ES book was ecma script 😂

*"Mapa hash, puda madre"*
(Hash map, motherf*cker)
        - Joma on overpreparing for interviews
"Hashmap, Motherfucker" doesn't really translate like that. Hmmmmm
🤣
What wil you do if you had a conflict with your manager? invert a binary tree.
#hashmapforlife
There was a longer version of this video, where can we see it?
"fucking love meditating " hahaha too funny
things you learn during overpreparing will still make you a better programmer overall so win win situation
haha
Lmao😂😂😂
Mapa hash puta madre!
I fucking love your videoes. Great humor. I gotta start meditating
Mapahash putamadre, jajajajajajaja
Fucking love meditating
0:26 hold a sec hold hold 🤣🤣😂
IT memes, so TRUE
i dont understand any thing but it funny and i laugh :3
Steven chow with programing jokes 
Nice 👍
I went once to a wedding and a lot of people were meditating in the bathroom.
I don't prepare for job interviews, I know the stuff I know and the employer looks at my profile before the interview.
If the employer asks me for things not in my profile and I can't answer them, then I'm not suitable for the job and if the employer failes to prepare for the interview I don't want do work there.
I've never done any of this. Never seriously prepared for interviews in my life. If i don't know the answer, i say honestly - i don't know. If i'm not concerned about my answer, i say something anyway, but i make a mark that i'm not sure that this is correct information. Eventually some of the interviewers correct me - this is the great opportunity to learn all the answers for all the typical questions.
Leave most important interviews for the last - you should do them with most confidence and experience of being interviewed you could have. You should be calm and confident - this is more important than learning the answers.
I've been an interviewer lots of times as well and I should warn you guys it is quite obvious when you know how to answer but you actually had never learned THE ANSWER. So please don't cheat, be honest - it's way more important. Remember that interview scene from "The Pursuit of Happyness" ("I'm the type of person...") - that was really strong move.
hi, what monitor are you using? could you send the model
We just going to ignore the fact he was doing rails in the bathroom lmao
Mapa hash hahahaha its still hashmap in spanish
Bro this guy! 🤣🤣🤣
yeah hashmaps can solve pretty much anything
0:13 will forever be iconic
Dude, I thought hashmap was where you score drugs man... Haha 🤣
_I love meDitating_
What is this program of the beginning with problem solves?
Hahahahaha. It's me 😫
how much psyduck have xd
ajajaajaja
HAHAHAHAHA humorously put
😭😂
I hate being in this industry lol
Ok, i wanst ready for the hashmap, may i should prepare more.
I noticed a Attack on Titan book.....
I don't like anime
If you got everything to prove, ask for two weeks of internship and prepare for a wild ride.
- do all this
- fuck up the Q-talent test in the most pathetic way possible
- cry
Quick international survey.   State where you are from ,and whether it’s common by companies ,to send you to evaluation centers.
Even if you aced all the 2months worth of stages. Ishhh
Oh …. I did get a question where the best answer was using a hash table! Go sheet cheats go! Lol.
When I was be interviewed, I feel I am going to do a program for moon-shoot. When I joined the company, I am fixing CICD issues...
So true 🤣🤣
I was actually interviewing a dev for a job the other day and my first question was "How would you handle a conflict with a coworker?" Hahahaha
Wrong Answer
Right Answer is use Tries
hahaha, hashmap, hashmap🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Doublelift wtf
I fucking love meditating
This is pain 😭😭😭
being a programmer is like living in the matrix your whole life. writing these imaginary languages to translate into something real, something real and stupid. then you wake up and you realize how much of reality you've wasted writing gibberish.
I did something similar for the first one, now I just smoke weed and don't give a f*ck.
Max was here
One of my interview questions recently revolved around a hashmap, this is too real
"Fuckin love meditating" killed me🤣🤣🤣
i fucking love Meth-itating
How my interview went: "I just came back from a year of vacation. My previous job was a legacy project that was obsolete 15 years ago, with no budget at all so I spent most of my time doing sysadmin stuff and fixing hardware. I don't know anything about modern coding, design patterns, I don't have a diploma, I didn't go to school, I've never used git, I've never tested any code or written any tests. On my free time I do java web applications but I've never used Spring." Them: "Cool, I like your attitude, you're hired. You start tomorrow." A couple months later I was up to speed and coding like the rest. Oddly enough, this team doesn't care about the tech at all. Anyone can learn anything.
Looks like Stephen chow
Many things ican connect those who are really bad at  data structures
This guy looks like tech lead
God, just seeing those language books makes me want to vomit.
I wish I could like this video ten times.
0:41 coke?
0:28 dam wish I cud baang dat guys wife...
The job: move an image slightly to the left  on the website
Could you give advise, if you haven't already on best eye protection while on the computer or doing work?
Ok
Very real. hahaha
LOL so accurate
The only real way to prepare is to ask five friends to think of the ten most asinine things a human could be asked to code then throw in three to five issues to make doing so as inconvenient as possible. You have ten minutes to solve five of these problems chosen at random with a random inconvenience.
Sigma Grindset #1746372: always lie on your resume and apply for jobs way above your skill level
LOL
Drugs are bad and efficient ppl dont use them.....shouldnt need to say this. F**cker
Is nobody talk about the meditation lol 😂
Wanted to share this on my works slack.
Can't cause of minor nudity rules 😅
Dev: Learns 250 design patterns with application examples.
Interviewer: “So, we are looking to add a contact form to our website. Can you do that? Yes? Great, you’re hired!”
Aaaah. Good old memories back in the old days when I had to be a engineer slave to the corporate dragons. 

Oh wait. Nah. I skipped this sh!t and just made my own corporation. I’m my own dragon now. 😎⭐️
It is so funny!🤣
Hashmap always do the magic trick
He really did coke in the middle 🤣
In all 3 languages. That's next level. Dang I'm so smart. Nice...
I never, ever prepared for a job interview. I only went to one job interview where I didn't get the job. XD
😂😂🔥🤦🏻‍♂️
Omggggg 🤣
Hey Thats mr.robot vibe 😂 Nice
Awesome.. funny 
Had me in stitches.  So good :D
Only shit I understood was the breathing exercise lol.
Sharding...haha
If his coding is as good as his Spanish then he is in real trouble
Why does having multiple screen feel and look sooo good.😇😊😍
If done even .0000000001 percent of that for my AWS interview I might of had a shot lol.
LOL, that was Doublelift and his lady.
Everybody: Hashmap
Me: If statement is better... If conflict, then solve, else delete source of conflict
hashmap equivalents to dictionary for C# developers xd
So I interview engineers and am normally on the front line doing behavioural interviews before we let people through to technical tests. And yesterday I asked this question and the silly twit started talking about how scrum processes can avoid all conflicts.

This video is more accurate than you might think.
jajajajajaj the hashmap at the end.... amazing
I like this fragment with 'breathing exercises' 😀
Fucking love meditating.
Hmm nice 😂
Here's a pro tip: rub one out before the interview it helps you seem less desperate. and take a shot of hard liquor to calm your nerves. This has actually never worked but I do enjoy the rest of the day
snorrr snorrr hahaha
"Breathing exercise" xD 
Shit was golden!
haha
I don't prepare and you are saying over prepare
Hashmap.. too fucking true xDD
I would CC the CEO in all my emails to the manager.
🤣🤣🤣
🤣🤣🤣🤣
0:38 FYI, the Chinese interview questions leaking website is called 一亩三分地
Fucking love meditating sounds like Fight club)
Mapa hash, putamadre
Wait, is this wrong?
Amazon and Microsoft interviews be like: Tagalog or Hindi?
I have couple of interviews coming up, i got to try these breathing exercises, have a feeling they work ;)
The breathing exercises killed me
Yeah, жиза.
Remember to randomly throw in technical words.
Of course hash map!
Please cut the part breathing exercice...is a bad example....for young people ....it can be interpretated as sniffing coca...i cannot support or share this content
Homie just snort some snow?
Joma the spanish bit nailed me XD
Does anybody know the site with code problems from 0:05?
I legit thought he would answer "his wife! I would bang his wife! .....shit!"
:))
日本人のお母さんかな
Hahaha
Not enough, you have to create some pet projects and better to have a commercial project experience, know how to use and apply patterns, project methodologies and cloud technologies
You are nuts. Shame shame to you
Meanwhile all I do is browse the company website for 5 minutes
All my homies missing the Doublelift/Leena instagram goof
Just be natural, go there and fuck what happens...I'm like that

Did you ever become a software engeneruh
😂😂😂
Mapahash puta madre.
LOL 😆
a si an
I will never forget that last words：hashmap，I will use hashmap！
the answer's always hashmap, nailed it
Mapahash p*ta madre lul
Wife is Leena Xu?? Nice
I never did any preparation for job interview(s) and still got the job(s). As someone who also interviews candidates, I never ask trick questions. It's not required. Everything I need is gathered from way of thinking.
All joking aside we have to over prepare they want 5+ years of experience for entry level… Regardless they usually still end up going with someone with more experience. 🙃
Most people don't realise that the most important part is to check the wife.
I also love fuckin meditating xD
The answer is always hashmapuuuhhh
This brilliant! 😂
I love you XD
If he said hashmap in Spanish this might have worked
Why you are not mentioning hackintosh that you build?
Hashmaps will stop the war, one day.
Hashmap is the key
【﻿ｐｒｏｍｏｓｍ】
This video is perfectly played. Exactly this happens in software developer or IT job profiles interviews. Made my day❤🤜🤛
I would ask a smarter person within the firm. Works every time.
Hm nice 😂😂😂😂😂😂🤣
Impressive.. really nice ...
More like:
“Employees be like”
😂
I just switched job and I can confirm every Joma step.. leatcode, books, questions, and responding a simple question with a complex solution 🤣
I would use try and catch and in the catch don't output the error. Conflict resolved!
You are creative ☺️
This is the best I saw in 15 years!
"f#cking love meditating"..
Hahaha ❤️🎉👍🎈🥳🙏
I don’t think I ever actually laughed out loud watching youtube
thank you
Read elememts of programing interviews in Spanish sounds super fucking hard
Dead 😂😂
Don't understand a shit, but that's funny 🤣
hash maps do have a constant lookup so I agree that is the optimal solution.
accurate
Mapa Hash Puta Madre lol!!!!
it killed me when he had the word conflict.   ..he just jumped to say hashmap
lmao this is now my ultimate favorite youtuber
Amazing 🤣
Thanks youtube i need a youther like that.
0:37 What is the name of Chinese website?
Wow i'm doing the exact same thing
Love these short sketches!!!!!!!!!
😂😂😂
Hashmap for every conflicts 🤣🤣🤣
hashmap HAHHAHAHA,
You are looking like Stephen chow Chinese king of comedy
i will use the hashmap!! 😂😂
This is great lmao
This is way too accurate
not over prepared at all, companies wanted me to be an expert in like 20 different things for a junior dev role in 2020. needless to say I didnt find anything till 2021.
mr robot lol
Literally how job interviews work these days. Cheat sheets. This is fucking hilarious and I highly believe this doesn't just apply to programmers.
Well I'm kinda curious... Which Sketchy website was he talking about?  :3
ohh man,, i do the same things.. lol

Lol you are too cute and funny
You look like Mike from 1rod1reelfishing ... LOL
the video's commenters definitely overprepped for their coding interviews - bossing it like pros. Love the intellectual heights of this video!
Mapa hash, putamadre!
The ending loool
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MjxoaynCmk  .... Would be a great idea if it turned into selecting software engineers for such a funny or serious big project.
Very interesting one minute video that awesome!  FINALY you back on track making such of those nice tech videos , hoping to see more dude.
that so fucking good hahhahaha
;)))
He really did meditate with one line of code huh
“Timed test”
Man overprepared for a programming job. Here is what happened to his career.
Bro
Loved it🤣🤣🤣
lol i read 115 programing books is not a joke
now i will learn all pure math curriculun then start to read about deeplearning and theorical computer science
then learn chinise
If anyone is wondering who that interviewer's wife is, its leena_xu. You are welcome.
got me at breathign exercises
0:11 this guy is a manga fan
exactly what i did for job interview
You could have used linked list
0:12 poor Amit Prakash only gets half the credit for Español version
This is the Harsh reality before interview.
The polar opposite of this (which is also too common) is companies wondering why they can’t find any good employees after 8 rounds interviews, 5 take home programming tests, and not being transparent with the salary of the position
comment
Nice
Mapa hash puta madre! For some reason I didn't get the job 🥲
I too love meditating.
一亩三分地 lmao
I smoked some pot before an interview last year. I mean I love the meditation
Nice, short video for my short attention span 😁
一亩三分地
Mapa hash putamatle
me who didn't do any leetcode and they ask me to solve it and i can't solve it in time lol
This is like when Eliot was hacking the FBI in Mr. Robot LoL
Anyone in here have to code in paper ???

So funny !
Ahahhah fucking love meditation

You have manga!? Damn bro ✨
If only I study like this :(
0:28 checking on Leena Xu 😏😏
how the h3ck did you know? You are just a data scientist, not a software engineer..why you making stuff?
This is a cinema masterpiece!
I see death note🤔
Didn’t Joma quit his data science job and study full time for software engineering for months and got depressed because of it ? 😂
"Don't understand sh#t but memorize every keyword" lmao. I can relate to that back then during my programmer days
What would you do if you had a conflict with your manager

Joma : hashmap
Me : we talk
“Mapa hash, putamadre” 🤣🤣🤣
so true
Great video! 👏
And don't do drugs 🙅
And don't reply to the bot impersonating Joma 💩
man if Hispanics came up with their own programming language that would be lit!!!
0:13 jajajajajajja "Mapa Hash Puta madre" xDDD , nice video!!
Python, C++ and… Spanish? Like.. Wat t heck? Hah 😂

You have earned a subscriber! I snorted so loud while watching this video!😂😂😂 I have never seen a more funny interview video.

🔥😂
That stalking part is accurate af.
Did that a few weeks ago before my interview :D.
Joma, you look like stephen chow 🙂
Mapa hash, puta madre B]
No idea what a hashmap is, but I laughed so hard at the confidence XD
Watched it several times. I still piss my pants at the end...
Como que  putamadre😄
😂😂😂
Okay, the fact is that, why would you memorise EVERYTHING and LEARN EVERYTHING if you're paying to have access of all leaked interview questions' answers – lmfao
I would use Quick Sort to sort it out!
😭 😭 😭 Why did I immediately know what he was doing in the bathroom 💀🤯
What is the Chinese website to get leaked interview questions?
Isn't this guy looks like Shaolin Soccer lead actor
Damn that’s hilarious, it really made my day.
😆😆😆I love your videos
一亩三分地，哈哈哈

Niceee 😂👍

Hashmapa putamadre! LOL
Damn you’re kidding, there can’t be a website to get the questions, must be a scam😂😂
: "You welcome." 😡😡
I'd use a kitten. Kittens solve all problems.
How come a 1 min video so entertaining 🤣
Doublelift interviewed you? 😂
He does look like @loiliangyang
Better ending ever
lmao this is great satire
The social media part tho 😂😂
ON. POINT.
The fun twist in the end is comparable to Anwar’s comic videos. It’s hilarious as hell
The abrupt ending makes it much better
Interviewer: what would you do if you have conflict with your manager?
Joma: Hash map
Interviewer mind voice: I know only Google map but what is hash map ?🤔
プログラミング言語を１０００以上設計開発する必要がありそうですね。プログラマーの全盛基調にあるなかで、もっと数多くのプログラミング言語の習得を目指してほしいなあ。
🤣🤣🤣
I didn't understand the spanish part...
LOL
Jajajajaja lol
LOL I asked this same question to one of the candidate :D
lol
what website was shown at the beginning
Fuck yeaa maan
Hmm..Nice.
😅HashMap😄💙🙏
That breathing exercise always worked for me during finals bruh 😂
Job interviews can be frightening sometimes. 🤩
I speak spanish and that's not how we say the f word
The breathing exercise involved snorting a special powder didn't it...
I don’t get the joke, you say you over-prepared but how else would you of known the answer is to use a hashmap?
Funny enough, I just got a new job and it was the one I didn't study for and purely relied on my experience and knowledge.
🇧🇷👨‍💻
Brasil
I just had 2 (separate) interviews in the past 2 days and I can't relate more

The first one didn't ask me to introduce myself which I had been practicing the most, then he mostly wanted to know what programming languages I had worked with. The coding task was literally just submitting the form.

The second one was more intense
There was a written test in which only 3 out of 13 qualified. I feel like I messed up the interview. I managed to answer all the theory questions, but they started asking brain teaser like problems
I couldn't answer this problem
There are 10 boxes, each box contains an infinite number of balls, the wait of each ball is 1g in all boxes except one which is 2g.
You have a weighing scale which you can only use once. How do you find the box with the 2g balls.
I just looked it up and I feel stupid
Anyone who uses that keyboard, well. Your'e lost.
Why study hard to get a job and become a slave for a company when you can make your own or start a business.
Meditation is cliche 🤫
jajajajajaj
Did anyone noticed that attack on titan and death note manga on 0:10 ? 😂
More or less accurate
L O L i DIED at the breathing exercise. I love meditation too.
"Checked HER wife". Can't guess people's gender by their appearance nowadays.
Fucking love meditating
Breathing exercise 😂💪🏿
Kdjdjskfhsjjs
what is the name of the website in the first part of the video?
I thought this was 5 minutes to be honest. Surprised that it was 1.
Lmfao.
HAshMAp 🤣🤣🤣🤣lol😂😂😂😂
Getting mr robot vibe
too much relatable
what is ur PC specs?
TNice tutorials video really helped! Thank you ❤
The moment that the Chinese website came out made me lmao
For every interview I've had, I always get disappointed with the questions they asked. Like.. I studied for this?? 
It is the norm for me to over prepare for an interview than not being prepared at all. Each interview I leave feeling confident knowing I've gotten the job even for posts I wasn't even qualified for.
POST THIS ON FACEBOOK !!
the end of so fun..... jjajaja
Bro why is this so accurate. I’m thinking of all technical answers I could say and they throw me off with tell me about yourself
If you must hash it out with your manager, a hashmap isn't a bad start.
first question must be "two sum" in which you use hashmap lol
New subscriber!
"hashmap, motherfucker" is gonna be the meme
Tbh mine two last interviews contained very few technical questions. Only a little chit-chat about project with PM and lead.
So if you're afraid of tech interviews try looking for a bank.
Mapa hash, p*ta madre
I hashmapped the subscribe button, your welcome.
Man, no one says "Mapa Hash" in Spain xDD
Worst case scenario, you could always use the death note :D 0:08
The 一亩三分地 team is here！
Hilarious 😂
Hhhahhahahhahaha yesssssssss
This is the real guide on how to be prepared for a coding interview. The rest are peanuts. Now I feel prepared. :)
no pls array list :))
My interviewer wore that kind of fleece as well, is it common now?
F word love meditating - this is level 9000 boys and girls! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I like the breathing exercises 😂😂😂
MAPAHASH, PUTA MADRE JAJAJAAJAJAJAJA
LOL, this is all true and funny
So tell me about yourself.
If I had a conflict I would git push --force and so my code would win.
"Fucking love meditating" 
I retired early with that one.
Amazing, love this, it made my Friday!
Bien ahí en lo de español :v
I had the best student job interview 🤣I was totally unprepared and had no idea what they were doing. The only thing I knew was that I want 15 bucks an hour and don't want to work more than 30 hours per month. Got the job. 😂 Now they are really happy that I can support them with their website.
bro,u r a real hacker,daymymyym
😂 😂 😂
The ending made me lol
The welcome got me
Checked her wife 😁😁😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
😂
mapahash puta madre XD
Joma is cool and stuff but damn that interviewer. Went to Harvard, SE at big tech with big money, hot wife. The only thing Joma has that he doen't is an ex wife.
Thanks for the laugh
Lmao smh so true 🤣😂
Mr Robot style
😂😂
🤣🤣🤣
hahaha Mapa hash put@ m@dre!
So what can you do? Me printf("Hello World")
😄
Everyone knows that the best way to resolve conflicts is by using vim
Literally spit my drink out. "Your welcome."
If you set the resolution to UHD and slow the playback speed, you can sort of make out the credit card number at @ 0:35. Just call me Mr. Robot 😎
how many inchs is your monitor?
Hashmap part was hilarious 😂
Hey what’s that website for system design?
I like the video but because I'm a need I really want to know what's monitor are you using
Hashmap always has your back
dude we need more IF PROGRAMMING WAS AN ANIME. those good old daysss....
WE WANT SECOND PART 😂🔥
Well that IS the answer to everything after all
HAHAHHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAH
THAT ENDING 🤣
Me now, just went theough meditation phase
joma
1990 software engineer interviews:

Them: "Okay, lets say you had a quarter."

Me thinks: Okay, I like this, maybe video games

Them,"How many more quarters would you need to stack them to the top of the empire state building."

Me thinks: This ain't a programming question, but okay... Empire state building like 1700 feet, height of a quarter is 1/10 an inch or 120 quarters per foot, so... I'm saying 204,000 quarters!

Them: WRONG! I said how many MORE quarters did you need, you did not listen to instructions and therefore will be a bad employee.  You didn't factor in that you already had a quarter.

Me: But I don't have a quarter.

Them: Exactly, and stay broke you wannabe a software engineer.  Go try and fool some other employer!  But we here in Midway cheerish our quarters.

Me:  This is stupid, why am I looking for jobs anymore. I'm done ever looking for jobs.

Them: Fatality!
"How we can solve global wa.." Hashmap!!! I'II use a Hashmap
Hash map, I use hash map lol 😆
Hey joma, There is one mistake.. u forgot to edit ur leetcode ranking. Its 175k. U only solved  247 questions and has no badges🤪
You are back ! 
Don't change, you are a killer
This is GOLD bro 😂😂😂
I would rather use Linked list to resolve the conflict. Seems a better option.
this is really funny 🤣
Actually some companies don't even ask for a test if you show them that you are skillful enough through the conversation and a huge portfolio. So, making your own projects is crucial.
Wtf that was tense and to the point
why not Binary Search?
🤣 that was great
xD
Intense meditation is the best
Bro getting viral on LinkedIn
Awesome content. 
Which make n model of wide monitor in the video?
LAMO, reminds me of Nas Daily..... 'That's one minute. see you tomorrow' 😁😁
jajajaja
🤘🤘🤘🤘
USE -F IN EVERYTHING
Is that Doublelift?
Yeee
It couldn't be that smooth ))
The “Mapa Hash P*ta Madre” was the best part 🤣😂
Truly one of the interview guides ever made. 👏
Loved it hahaha
LOL!
Mapa Hash p*ta madre!
Except for that last question and paying someone for interview questions.everything he said is true and at times a bit scared too.🤣🤣
Good call on the hash map
a job like programming is too cognitively stressful. If you suffer from depression or brain damage or stress you'll fail and get fired.
Can you upload this video on TikTok, I will want download the video 😂
I usually just take a lot of breathing exercises and hope for the best.
Best content I’ve seen in years
This is literally me lol expect for the paying stuff cuz im so broke xD
Did Fung convince you to put in a cameo of Snap
can relate. The worst is when they ask "tell me a little about yourself". My mind goes blank.
Omg finally found this channel again. Do u guys know that moment, you watch a video don't subscribe and then forget the name of the creator? 😂
Hahaha did some this like stalking my interviewers
What website did he use to have that many problems to solve?
omg i cant stop laughing lmao the end send me
Adapt to your manager. Use Manager Adapter. Then use a lazy initialization for your abstract revenge builder.
Ah I love meditating JAJAJAJAJAJ
一亩三分地哈哈哈哈哈1point3acres笑吐了
Top way to solving a conflict with manager 
Top 1: " hash map "
Python, C++ and SPANISH!!! 😂😂😂
The ending sent me 😂
lol so accurate 🤣
So we aren't going to talk about his OP bathroom meditation session?
I know that breathing technique. You have so much energy afterward :)

And can't sleep xD
Hashmap knowledge is defo true
Doublelift loool
deep fried hash map bueeeeyybbiiiiiiiiiiii
brilliant
I’ve hired a bunch of tech people over the years and I’d have to say that personality and values are way more important than any technical skills
Facts
I remember when I got an interview for a programming job. It was over email and they stopped replying and I thought they had ghosted me. So I replied with "next time grow a pair and tell me I don't get the job"...

It was a Friday. They replied the next Monday and I definitely did not get the job. 

Not sure what I expected the outcome possibly could have been from doing that but I just chalk it up as growing up. lol
What is the uniform resource locator for that Chinese website
I squealed
Programming interviews are a joke. We need a better way to do this that is comprehensive and flexible for growth across the industry, and not just do what Google and Amazon do. Interviews currently feel like gambling.
I JUST did an interview and this is exactly what i did!!!😂😂😂 so accurate
killed it 😂😂😂
LMAO!!
When you are a junior developer many things happen.
Someone need junior front-end developer (React). Just answer here and leave your contact
Why is he going so fast!? 
00:40 huh! Nevermind
"You're welcome".
lol That’s ture.
i’m dead xD 
„I fucking love meditating“
You made my day, man!
I can't pass the ' Checking Their Wife ' step, not sure what is my problem....
I've been a professional software engineer since 6th of June 2022. It's my first coding job and I was offered it 2 weeks after handing in my university final project. The interviews I had for this role were the easiest interviews I've ever had (I'm 32 - I've applied for and been rejected for many jobs, most of which were fucking unskilled shit that a trained monkey could do).
"mapa hash, puta madre" xD
THen you go to the interview and they hire you without asking anything because there is a shortage of developers.
I think lot of these interviews end up in confirmation that you are not crazy, and can interact with other human beings







... by using a hashmap
GO THROW A HASHMAP AT THE PROBLEM!!!
<BTC truly is a class of its own, it has no competitors. All the other alts are competing with each other, they are more centralized, and the majority of them are not completed projects. I can't believe it when I hear people selling their btc for doge lol, that why I trade with the best analysts since the last bear which I attain maximum success through Walter Charleston .
Read lot book and boom the question is about team management, nice
That was a great answer. Hash maps resolve conflicts in constant time!
hasmap baby
how is his rank still 175k after solving 1.5k problems and he also has a knight batch
Ахахахахаха
😂😂"hash map  use a HASH MAP"
Actually I would use DP. I have all the past sub problems saved and ready to be thrown at the manager.
As DBA, I would have said ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE
wha te hel did i just watch 😂, love u joma
Would be good if you extend the interview xD
😂😂😂😂😂🥲hash map 😂😂
lmao HASH MAP!
i would definitely deploy that hashmap in kubernetes first.
Why is this sooooo good??! Lol
I think the fact that I understood the wife was Leena Xu just from 1 random pixelated face photo is impressive
😂😂😂
Sad. People using drugs openly.
😂
😂😂😂
KKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK
uh... nice!
how to be Joma?
if you stay as a tech, your views will be high over Ms.. look at those digital currency ones... what's the point?
Usaria un mapa hash la re puta madre!
😂😂
Thats Leena Xu @00:28 😂
Like your setup
just checked your linkedin, it's perfectly empty, bro what the hell are you teaching people about programming, first do it yourself. You are just a theater artist who can act quite well.
AHAHAH LOLL
Oh my god thank you very much Joma, that made me laugh for hours.
Have an interview upcomin for equipment integration engineer, do you guys have any advice for me cause I'm super anxious rn?
this is so funny, very relatable on my current situation. 🤣 still job hunting tho. 😖
Joma bruh🤦🏿‍♂😂😂 bruhman's always killing it 😂😂 "Hash Map, I'll use a hash map" | you were meant for writing and acting bro, I know you're a OP Coder, but you definitely found your second calling bruh 😂😂 🙌🏿
😆
😆😆😆
Breathing exercis.  🤣
Lol 😂
Laugh all you want, but the reality is that for all the * Engineer roles in big tech, you will get asked this kind of stuff (data structures, algorithms, etc.) + behavioural questions.
Haha...may be in US. Here in India they interview sr sw eng like college graduates. Once I have interview without any such prep after no interview exp for 5 yrs. I cleared all rounds by US teammates. They asked questilns arnd what I worked on. But Indian team guys asked me questions that we used to solve college.
https://youtube.com/channel/UC3dCqLF6ZQZp0vr9wbaz2rQ
Isn’t that censored lady Leena 😂
Took me about 5 failed interviews to finally get an offer out of college. Studying a bunch of data structures and algorithms majority of the time will mess you up more than help. Learn from past interviews, study projects you have done and just relate problems/solutions to stuff you know. If the recruiter values your projects and passion on things you did, as well as fits the work their doing, you will probably get the most enjoyment out of that work environment anyways.
check their wife 😂😂😂
Hashmap motherfucker, is correctly translated to 'Hashmap, hijo de puta ❤️'
I love the grounded reality of this channel.. <TA is all well and good but I find it truly baffling that all major crypto youtubers just look at pure TA and completely ignore the bigger narrative of why BTC is fluctuating and why the future outlook is more encouraging as it seems. It's kinda irresponsible to ignore the fact that each ETF launch so far has caused a major dump at the peaks of BTC. We were already on shaky footing with historically low volume and almost pure whale pumps, narrowly avoiding a long-term bear market. This is the worst possible time in history to invest as so many don't back up their crypto assets. More emphasis should be put into day tradiing as it is less affected by the unpredictable nature of the market.I have made over 10.8btc 4rm day tradng with Louis Chung insights and signals in less than few weeks, this is one of the best medium to backup your assets incase it goes bearish....
"I fuckin' love meditating."
Hmm.....nice
I missed these kind of videos!!!
wait, whats that website at the begging were you solve coding problems ?
mappa hash, puta madre
What a smart joke 😅
You forgot to edit the "rank"
Sooooo... Leena eh?
Predicted another ending, but what JOMA did was way too much funny
Good work my man
Of course you must use a HashMap man
Hashmaps always!!!
Hahahaha so good.
Calm down, sir
The answer is always a hash map unless it’s a binary tree (especially an inverted one)
I would just skip the interview cutscene with a .JIT installer
'Your welcome" gets me everytime i rewatch the video 🤣
Woahhhhh hooooo!!!! lamooo it's just awesomee!
Basically "Mapa Hash putamadre"
Interviewer: heeey thanks so much for hopping on this call!

Me after a short breathing exercise in the bathroom: you're welcome (with a dead stare)

Interviewer: ummm

Looool
I have no words to describe how creative was this video. Hahahahaha
For those of you that don't know, this video is highly influenced by the video 'the hustle' by Krazam
I interviewed for a unique role where it blends web development, product management, and marketing. It's with a large corporation, they offer a high salary, and I'll be working with a lot of seasoned professionals.

I prepared like hell for everything and expected the toughest questions to be brought up. Coding question: do you have any experience with HTML? Product management: have you worked with Agile before? Marketing: what forms of marketing have you worked with? Yup, it was that basic.

I spent days preparing for questions like, "Can you map out a marketing strategy that would increase our CTR without raising our CPL, using the example data table that we've presented. Please notate all calculations in detail and your thought process." (this one came up from another interview for a similar position)

The rest of the interviews were spent talking about video games, cars, and things we liked and disliked.
0:13 jajajajajajajajajajaja
What's that Chinese website he referred to? Its the only thing I am missing in my job prep
The Python, C++, and Spanish joke killed me
By showing that chinese forum about interview preps and saying it's sketchy, just a shallow content creator.
how programmers over-comment a video about job interview preparation 🤣
Hahahah I'll use the hash map 😂
Sr, we have good news and bad news. 
The good news is that you got the job! 
The bad news is your salary will be 66% less for 36 months and, in the last month, you will do a new interview, 1 technical test, and 3 back flips. 
I
Hash, Hash, what you ate too much hash brown your brain turned into potato?
Metitating
"mapa hash, puta madre" 👍
hahahahahahahahahaha
spot on lol
is the breathing exercise from the mountains of Colombia? 😂
Lmao I wish this was longer this was so good
Just brilliant 😁😅🤣
Bro I have one question to ask, if you  want to venture into building software for autonomous cars, do you study computer science or software engineering
mapa hash, puta madre 😭😭☠
What is the name of the website that is used to solve challenges?
Very nice very nice
Someone tell me about the monitor setup
mapa hash puta madre xD
0:13 c mamó este wey
I feel personally attacked lol 😂😂😂
Pfff, what a chump. Obviously you need a neural net here trained on cats and dogs to solve the conflict the right way
Joma making software engineering humorous and funny videos I think is more fun to watch because he started like that..
His new videos are great too.. can see the hard work and attention to detail..
But funny tech and software engineering vidos to me is why I loved Joma so much 🎸
killed me with the breathing exercise lmaoooo
Dear Joma, I love your videos haha. Could you share the design pattern cheat sheet ? Thanks so much. Kind regards from Argentina !
"motherfucker" will be more like "hijo de puta"
Hashmap in spanish its still Hashmap 🙄
Love the death note book
😂😅😂
Interviewer: Hey! Thank you so much for hopping on this call!
🗿: You’re welcome
hash map, pvta madre
MAPA HASH PUTAMADRE
I just realised this is exactly my days look like. 😐.. Every detail except chineese website is accurate in my case
Check his wife 😄😂 00:27
Hashmap putemadrhe
😂😂😂
Ok first! Can you please the interviewer's profile? Even I have a interview to prepare for.
This is so funny 😂🤣
"What's a Hashmap?"
👀
0:26 bruh I know who that is. It's DoubleLift lmao
:D:D:D:D:D
The answer to every question is "stack overflow"
That really shocked my mind
You failed because in spanish "motherfucker" is "hijo de puta"
Fuckin ❤ meditation 🧘‍♀️
I am on my way of picking up my laptop which has a failure on the hard drive (RIP) but hearing in spanish "mapahash puta madre" 😂😂 made my day
😂
what did you smell bro? 🧐
😀 😃 😄 😁
ITS LIKE LIMITLES SBUT JJOMAADIS IS IT
I watched this just before my interview. How fucking relatable this is...
Me meanwhile: print(“Hello world!”) 😆

I think he passes the interview. Hashmap is a well-known resolution to solve conflicts with m-
I'll use a hashmap.. 🤣🤣🤣👍👍
🤣🤣🤣 This is so funny!
This is so accurate! 😭😭😭
It's much better to be overprepared than nothing 😂
Absolutely, sir. ^ _ ^ Response["*Conflict*"] = "Hashmap"
What’s so funny? Hashmap is the correct answer.
Hilarious 🤣🤣🤣
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
If anyone is thinking of purchasing Joma’s courses, be aware you will be signed up for recurring payments. I was debited for another yearly subscription, for which I don’t need. I have attempted to amicably resolve this issue with Joma, but he has not responded. To anyone reading this, choose another training provider who operates fairly and communicates clearly with students
Please can you share your cheat sheets?
0:02 What's the name of this website?
Its always hashmap
Joma, you could easily be a comedian 🤣🤣🤣. This was so funny!!
We need more episod
Breathing exercise
Lol. Its me
Except you'd have to get an interview first. I've learned that my undergrad degree in Comp Sci makes me suitable for just about nothing. Nice of HR to spare the air to tell me 'no' at least
😂😂😂😂😂
Pretty much how my interview prep is going at the moment lol
一亩三分地太真实了😁
I went to " toilet to have breathing exercise " :P lol
This is very funny 😄
Hashmap 😂😂😂
😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣
Hahahah made my day
一亩三分地😂😂😂sketchy Chinese website
im meditating a lot too 🤣🤣🤣
xDDD
This supposed to be youtube shorts joma
😂😂
Gue kira HARUN MASIKU.
If I had a conflict with my manager I'd probably sort it out
This is representation of what most people think a SW engineer interview looks like (actual interviews are completely opposite of this)
Mi primer idioma es español y sigo sin entender qué dice.
I will use the garbage collection in Java, to collect the “conflicted” manager as garbage (just kidding
you came in overprepared lmao
I recently started meditating/breathing and it's been fucking awesome - trust me lol
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
epic
Can relate...
Good job here
Or just threaten to write their name in the deathnote at 0:10
"mapa hash puta madre"🤣
Bruh they ever ask me to center a div I'm rage quitting society and living as a nomad in the Mojave desert
Lol 😂
Is that Doublelift and Leena?
00:55 'You're welcome;' 🤣
Lol I speak spanish and I've never heard someone saying  mapahash
i have 300 leetcodes questions done and still dont know wtf am i doing on new problems lol
I just loled... 😂
this is gold
Yes this is what happens when you just memoriez things instead  of learning
0:04 Solved 1513 problems and yet still rank 175,887. Can't imagine what the top-rank geeks look like. 👾
nice, just checking if your reply  is not a web hook 😂
The “You’re welcome!” got me hard. Totally unexpected and I almost spat my drink out at my screen.
0:13 as a spanish native speaker I must say I had to repeat that part like six times to really understand what you were trying to say, I can't believe you just said "puta madre"
nice
Wayyyy toooo quiiickkk lol!!
remember last enterview, i did not know what to say, so i said "ill use a hashmap", they dont call me again lol
rofl!
You're all wrong.

GIT BLAME MANAGER!
Me right now trying to overprep for interviews 😩
Joma the genius 😂
HASHMAP
Act like they expect you to be a little memorizing rat
Mapa hash, p*ta madre. I felt that
😂😂😂oh man…I use to do the same, spend hours cramming information and get asked the silliest questions ever.
yeah, sintaxis & translation error on "Mapa Hash, pu7@ madre" at 0:15 . But that bad word can be used to solve ANY conflict in Spanish. That should give you extra points in your interview.
Was asked a graph problem, god i hate graph problems.
Actually this is what you have to do these days
i literally did this not long ago. turn up to the job and its like 1% of my total power is being used.
hahaha
Dont understand shit but memorize every key word
No one cares.
Wait, you guys have interviews?
I didn't prepare at all and was shocked how much they focus on algorithms and data structures.
Question 1: What is your name
Question 2: What is your favourite colour
Question 3: Please explain the quake inverse square root
0:14 had me haha
I just had another rediculus tech interview... I was applying for a .net role, so the position was asking to know JavaScript and Angular among the .Net, those are not .NET and i said that to the recruiter maybe is not for me, she insisted to have the interview. i then went and study 2 days all kind of theories, and architectures for .net to Refresh them, i wen to the interview and they only ask me Angular and JavaScript fshit questions. 
I ended the interview in 5mins. This was rediculus and a waste of time.

Happened so many times.
🎯
😂
Guy didn't even study git.
damn another cunning content creator i have to follow now on youtube *face palm*
Rejected for not employing a brute-force approach to begin with, instead prematurely making use of a hashmap to solve the problem.
I roughly read 2000 pages about C# to get my dream job as a C# Dev (books from Jon Skeet and Micheal Richter, I can really be recommend their books). Ended up getting a JS and Python Job. The payment is stellar though.
I heard you could be declined for being over-prepared
I laughed so hard
I wonder how many developers are drug addicts for real
Muy bueno!!! 🇦🇷
1:09 of time duration ?? It should be only one minute. Try your best next time!....... :-p
only the most proffesional developers use hasmaps irl
OMG this is sooo me hahahah.
that’s Leena
Mapa hash puta madre. Lmao, actually you can say Hashmap hijo de puta, nvm youre hired
Morale: they will always find a question you have no clue how to answer
0:09 mf really thought he'd sneak in a coding book in his manga collection of Attack on Titan and Deathnote & that we won't notice
There are so many rumors about joma that he is a cheater 🦶🏻🦶🏻🦶🏻
💥💥boom , ROFL🤣🤣🤣
The end was amazing, haha
Seems I am the only one that caught the death note Easter egg @ 0:09
And if you fail, you can go ahead and write your interviewer name in your Death Note ☠ at 0:09
Code problem site?
😂😂😂 I guess this is HR question
I was not expecting that, well played.
this guy feels like mordern ryan higa
Hey man, I am Spanish native speaker, and your Spanish sounds so well, you just need to keep like this and some or later you will reach a good level of it.
watch it in 1.25x it gets wild
I also love meditating
I DID NOT EXPECT THAT
Saw that How to DeathNote book nice
Fucked my coding interview minutes ago, did tasks before that, memorized algorithms and failed to reverse the list in python GREAT
笑死
Exactly what I did for my first interview😂
Thanks!
Literally me when I overprepared my exam in one day lmao
😂😂😂😂😂💪
Lmaoooo don’t forget rehearsing the company’s values
Best answer i have ever heard
THIS IS LITERAL ACCURACY
Really you are portraying programmers as superheroes,  and we all know 90% of them copy paste from stackoverflow and Google!!!!! Only 10% are creative and developing frameworks apis ... for the average Mr copypaste programmer
1:07 Hadn't laughed this hard in a long time  🤣
I need this setup at my place...
can someone tell me which mice does he uses at 0:55 seconds 
thanks in advance
"You are welcome" with a serious, concentrated face. It gets me every time 🤣
What is your name ?
My ya..I am recursion...silly me...nah linkedlist
This is just as funny as it is accurate lmao. 😆
Dam, the answer is always Hashmap
Aperently Hashmap solves everything😅
Joma you look like Jota, an action actor from Indonesia 😁
Hahahahahahahaha
That 'conflict' and 'hashmap' was too op🤣
Seriously laughed so hard at the end
Definitely on point here!
Joma is a genius~ g
一亩三分地，，，绷不住了 dude
meh the video was so damn good 
😂
Man,  I must admit it was a good video, find it very funny 🙂
Omg! U are so funny 😂😂so relatable
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂that quick answer😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
putamadre xD ...that'd be...'tu puta madre'
Hmmm breathing
breathing exercise is good for any type of interview.
I'll use hashed potato
Great content in a minute, impressive !
this is what makes me mad. ;)
It's nice to see a fellow Buddhist becoming a famous tech youtuber :)
😁HaspMap......I use a HashMap 😁
Good for everything
The "Elements of Programming Interviews" exists in free languages - Python, C++, and Java. I assume Spanish is Java.
😃😃😃😃
If I had a conflict with my manager I'd quit.
I feel here true Lonely Island vibes. I'm also a motherlover.
jajash mapa
Is spanish a program language?
Link to interviewer’s instagram??
Hello! Can somebody say how that site is called on 0:03 ?
Jajajajajajajaj
I'll try mapa hash puta madre on my next interview
Mapa hash jajajaja
Hashmaps fix all problems
The way he says "Hashmap, I'll use Hashmap" had me laughing😂
0:09 Attack on Titan AND Death Note ... He definitely knows his stuff ...
Lmao I can't with you
It's remind me when I never passed some of coding test. 
But work as a programmer. 
Now getting old, and I couldn't pass simple coding test, hahaha...
The 'your welcome' is the best, most insightful part of this interview.
0:28 nice
Doublelift went from Pro-player to code interviewer, good for him
Do one on how companies expect you to use esoteric algorithms to solve problems
😂😂😂😂😂
I'M DYING
hash, hash, you eat too much hash brown your brain turned into potato
In 1min u nailed it 🤣🤣🤣 your content is amazing bruh💫💯
holy sht he was on LEENA's profile im fucking dying. my boi doublelift!
Really anticlimactic that the interviewer wasn't DoubleLift 😞
U win when u memorise 1500 leetcode questions
lmao 🤣
I wasn't expecting for the video to end, I was so immerse, this absolutely broke me lmao
mapa has puta madre lolll
;:
Imagine a world where hashmap isn't the answer to every software interview question......sheesh I wouldn't have a job........oh
Bruh 😂
0:14 whats that😂
hashmap is always the right answer
0:06 how I study the moment before my exam
I’d love to know how I could make a desktop setup like what you work with. I wouldn’t even know where to begin or how you use each attachment lol.
I'll use the hashmap, damn! 😂😂😂
I don't even know what Hashmap is yet, but it made me laugh
I’m studying for an interview in a few days that feels super out of my league so this was perfect timing haha
sauce at 0:28 is Leena Xu
The actual first question would be "share your screen and show us some of your code" and then you frantically closing every cheat sheet while trying to look calm and collected
mapa hash pta madre!
Meditation, yeah right😅
"you're welcome" lmaooo
Relatable
You're welcome LOLOLOLOL
Wow that meditation really got you going ….
I laughed out loud so hard when he went into the bathroom to snort coke
😀😀🤣🤣Always the silly questions
i fucking love meditation powder 😂😂😂
We all searched for Peter huang didn't we?😄
AND IT WORKS!
0:40 meditation baby
My favorite so far
0:45 😂😂😂horrible
Wrong! The answer was I’ll use a mapa hash, puta madre.
Just made my day! 🤣🤣🤣🤣 ‘Fucking love meditating…..’
00:09 he reads death note
0:42 using the infinty stones in the most efficient way
LMAO this guy is a goddamn genius!
This dude is so Cash Money, I went ahead and liked the video while the unskippable ads were still playing!! 😎
Omg too funny. lmao
"I f@ckin love meditating" LMFAO.
That monitor shake at 0:32 made me nervous 😅
😂😂😂😂
This video was awesome
I hate the interviews. An interviewer could be cool or mean. Asks for everything or nothing and just going to code live. Resolve an easy problem or edges cases or very specific issues. And even when pass all, can get a “no”

I have the interviews….
😭😭
😆
😂😂😂
which monitors are you using?
Thanks 4 this beautiful video man. Really brings up my mood and coding spirit. Love u man
🤣🤣🤣
Stop being so accurate please
"Hmm... nice"
hashmap
“I go to the bathroom for my breathing exercice” this part is so damn hilarious
I even start to take code now haha
Ahaha love it.
😂l always stalk my interviewers
This sums up my last interview perfectly lmaooo
0:28, the wife's twitter/instagram link please
For any strange situation use a hashmap
MR. Joma
Yeah, me  I will  use binary tree data structures 😂
HAHHAHAHAHA
Can anyone finish these preparations before an interview...?
🤣🤣🤣
G.E:N.I.U.S
"Mapa hash, puta madre!" lol
LOL I just had an interview with IBM for a systems support position and was memorizing boot sequences, network lingo, reviewed all tools i used, and learned IBM Watson's structures and their history and my programming projects that would relate to the position etc etc.... IBM interviewer: "so i see you worked at Nissan before. My brother had one and hated it. Are the transmissions really that bad? I was looking at one this week"
This right here, is why I hate job interviews.
This is so funny damn hahahahahaha
What is that website with the problems to solve
Didnt see that answer coming... xD
Bruh 😂😂
0:29

Impressive. Let’s see Paul Allen’s wife.
Job Interview: Why do you want to work here ? 
Me  : I don’t know.. a recruiter sent me this job a day ago and said that I could be a good fit.
Loll I had a interview recently they asked me how would u explain a technical concept to users and I started talking about tuples 😂😂
I have an interview tomorrow and this is what I am doing ahhahahaha
I love meditating!
Lost my shit at that Death Note notebook shot 🙈
too real. 🤣
1point3acres GOAT
Spanish lmaoooo😂
puta madre¡¡¡¡🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Does anyone have the id of Interviewer's wife??😅
Check interviewer’s wife, such an Elon Musk move
what's the website at 0:38 ?
0:26 is that doublelift? xd
Hahaha🤣
This reminds when I used to study the previous whole classes lectures when the exam date cames with something different.
Interviewer: We will let you know how your interview went.
This brought back so much trauma man. I don't want to prepare for interviews anymore.
I thought it would be like:
So you have 8 years of experience, right?
I have 7 but look at my perform..
Bye
Imagine prepared so much and then just spam random shit to those questions lol
"Mapa hash puta madre" 🤣🤣🤣, I'm a fan from Mexico, that made my day.
lol legit!
Fucking masterpiece
What a nerd
Gotta have the Spanish down brosef
100% accurate, prepping for interviews right now. The Leetcode grind is real. I hate it with a passion and I hate how interviewing has devolved into this.
0:14 I'm remembering this phrase lol
Who is Peter Huang btw?
Thanks! Nice route bro, except for the "meditation" part, I will do the same haha
lol
The legend Hashmap
You killed me with that "mapahash p5t1 madre"
The story of my life.
Solving conflicts by using a hash map, welp there's some probing to do then!
Congratulation you got the Job 😂
and motherfuckers would be "hijos de puta" 🙃
i dont know if hahsmap is mapa hash i think it has another name. (Im from seville, spain)
hash map solves everything
Ugh all these interviews when we can just stackoverflow everything
My interviewer asked me if I know binary search, I said yeah that ? Preorder, inorder, postorder. I know ! XD Mf me jumped all the dsa to binary tree when he asked a simpler one.
hashuuu mapuu~~
you so good
you so good
love that monitor
Meditating part😂😂
Aye.. whats the chinese site... asking for a friend
Hasha mapa nani kore
🤣🤣🤣🤣
Hahaha me hiciste reir mucho felicidades por tu gran contenido saludos desde México!!!
gold
Great video. I have literally zero personal connection to the subject matter but I still found it funny.
Not a programmer, but an IT Guy, I can relate to this.
That meditation technique is out of this world
python, c++ and spanish. hahahahah
Hashmap will be use for mapping your character with HR's character 🤣🤣
bool isQuitting = true;
Is joma's room getting messier every video?
Exactly all of what I did 😂
Interview was far too easy, passed before walking out of the room.
He's definitely seen Mr. Robot several times.
what is that drug u sniffing? Does it make ur brain function faster?
You're hired
Checking somebody's wife face is necessary for preparing interview, mark this
"You're welcome" 🤣
What is name of that monitor you use?
You sound like Mr. Robot.
The sad truth when you realize this sketch is real
Haha
Lopa
Hi joma , do you kniw any of best free python courses.
mapa hash, puta madre
Replication, aggregation, sharding:
Now I am the interviewer
The Spanish got me gud
You can start a garbage collector to free trash memory.
"python, c++, and spanish" lmaoo
Whatever the question, answer is always Hash map 😂
Joma you are a legend😂This is so funny
Lmfao this is funny after. The hashmap got me bcz I was studying hashmap too🤣
You are welcome 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I wud code in binary
Can't stop watching this
lol
😂
Bruhhhhhh 🤣
You can never hate Joma
si bangsoy kocak wae mamang ieu, salam uyy ti indonesia
This was hilarious !
So I am a Graphic Designer I was asked how would you design a TV stand. Interviewer forgot I was neither a 3d model designer nor an interior designer.
Hope this is a part -1
Literally my Chinese speaking tests be like
When your life is based on neural networks
you don’t know anything but you just simply answer to keywords
i nearly spit my drink the way u said you're welcome lmaoo
You forgot to say puta madre at the end.
"fucking love meditating" LMFAOO😂
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
:)))
Hahahahahaha! So funny, love your vids and humor!
i laughed alot😂 at hashmap
The "YOU'RE WELCOME." Lol thats totally what you guys are like
mapa hash , puta madre
My day will be made if Joma pins this comment :3






not really....
Good try, it always is the hasmap.
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Shit that 1point3acres thing really got me🤣
Oh my word, this piece of content is legendary. 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
LMFAO
i see so i'm overprepare
yah stephen chow
Literally true story. Aced the AWS online test only to get grilled by 40mins of LPs (recruiter said it would 1-2 questions at the end). I feel like they knew I memorised 1000 leetcode questions.
The LinkedIn stalking was spot on 😂
I think recursion would be better. I would suggest to keep arguing with manager till the point he fires you. Space complexity is 0(n) and time complexity would be simply 0(n).Simple
why do i feel like hashmap is now a meme in programming world
 lol
He was on point. Basically. 
<hash: to chop (food, such as meat and potatoes) into small pieces>
一亩三分地笑死我了
Hahahaah Mofo actually translates to Cabron but nice try Joma. Saludos desde Alemania
Hashmap is everything 😂😂 take it or leave it
When in doubt, hash it out.
Native Spanish speaker here. That "Put@ madre" caught me off guard 😂
interviewer: What would you do...
me (interrupts interviewer): I always use a hashmap.
😂
That's how I prepare for my interview minus some things he mentioned like stalking the interviewers. I just know enough to BS my way! 😂 Also, they threw weird unrelated questions that threw me off one time.
wow.. it was only 1 minute??
Just so that everyone feels good joma has 194 questions on his leetcode. 0:18
@doublelift
Dude basically clarified that all of these are required to prepare for interviews
Puto AMO!! tal cual es asi
Can you guys educate me what is Hashmap?
Isn’t that Doublelifts girlfriend?? LMFAO
Welcome ...came with speed of light ..joma is 🔥😂😂😂😂😂
Funny as phuck 😂😂😂😂
very nice, let's see Paul Allen's hashmap
0:43 breathing meditation before interview u got me bro 😅
hahahaha😂
Mapahash putamadre
Hashmap is always the best answer.
HAHAHAHAHAHA
then they ask who sent you ...
That was the most content I’ve ever seen in 1 minute🔥
memoize it
HashMap solves everything!
you updated the number of questions answered , but forgot to update the rank.
0:51 Are we gonna ignore the wallpaper 🤣 I click pictures just like this to troll people
I don't get why they don't just give you problems related to the field you're into? they just give you general problems to solve 💀, I'm a mobile app dev, why do I have to write an algorithm that calculates the minimum time it takes for a number of files to execute given the number of threads 💀 I'm gonna be your backend dev, why do I have to solve this? ...I have that book, cracking the coding interview 😹 but I've never opened it once
Pretty accurate, at least for me :)
it's so fvckin relate.... damn joma
This guy is the best 
Thanks for amazing nft project Vaxxed Doggos on solana
"You're welcome" hahaha
This is absolutely genuine 😅🙌
That actually what I’m doing right now LOL
WIFE SAUCE???!!
Lmfao
Mapa hash jajajaja
hey joma, i got into python world because of your content and now i am doing data stuff(fivetran(custom connectors), snowflake, ELT, etc) inside my project. just want to say thank you also got a small salary bumped and helping now my sibling financially in school. btw what is your workout routine and diet? 

- 🇵🇭
lol HashMap, Mashup
Most competent software devs can learn and adapt to new technologies (i.e. google what something is and how it works). But adapting to a team of people is harder and that's what most interviews want to figure out.
Dois detalhes interessantes:
1- Os livros adjacentes ao Elementos da Entrevista de Programação
2- Você usando o tradutor para entender este comentário horrível e desnecessário.
The power of the hash map cannot be understated
I do not miss this feeling
Checked his wife…. NICE 😂🥲
That’s exactly how I prepare
Imagine if the inverviewer sees the video and the part where he *"checks his wife"*
this is so good
Is there a sketchy Chinese website that leaks Interview questions?
🤣🤣🤣
HOLY FUCK I LAUGHED SO FUCKING HARD AT THE MEDIATION JOKE
😂😂😂😂😂
git checkout --ours, then git add . then git merge
Coca Cola
wrong answer! I'd use a binary tree with recursion
Noo bro :(, the last answer was wrong... the correct answer was "Mapa Hash, puta madre".
is behavior question out instead 🤣
1point3 lmao....The membership is 40$ per month.
I remember i prepared 2 weeks for computer science engineer job i look ok the internet for all possible technical questions i prepared a word document. Then the interviewer asked me how i manage not to watch porn at work??. I failed 😅😅😅
Obligatory DL + Leena shoutout?
This is too accurate! 🤣🤣🤣 Also me right now, preparing for a final final interview tomorrow!
Nunca pensé escuchar a un asiático no latino decir "puta madre"
*You're welcome!* 😂
😂😂😂😂😂
Nice breathing exercises. Lmao
Motherfucker is not putamadre 🤦🏻‍♂️ you shouldn’t trust on google translator. Motherfucker in Spanish could be “cabrón”, which is not bad nor good, it depends on context. Putamadre is more like “fucking well” or similar, which is always positive, no matter the context. And Programming Motherfucker means “programando cabrón”. Do you speak it?
breathing technique is missing link in my interviews definitely
how hashmap the hashmap than hashmap with a little bit hashmap
Man, I choked
the meditation step, it's always recommended!
Amigos don't forget the most important part...

0:13 - MapaHash Puta Madre
Hilarious
I'd hire this guy on the spot, because a hashmap is exactly what I'd use to key in every conflict keyword to a ready made answer in O(1), puta madre.
Haha)
LMAO this really cracked me up man. good job
This is one of the greatest of yours
LAST PART: HASHMAPPPPP
This is much better than the 'Do Kwon' video. That was a bit 'niche' - and boring.
I have got an interview tomorrow and I am trying the meditating thing.
I'm' Spanish Native and don't understood what he said
I'd use DFS to find the closest melee weapon available and then I'd bin Search the most efficient angle to smash his head with it. To run away, I'd use A*
These interviews are real pain in the ass. Software development has gone to shit over years as they expect you to know everything, know about latest tech stack and want you already use it. Even if you do well in interview, it's not a guarantee you will be hired. They want you to do assignments with at least 2 days of work, then when you finally finish, it takes them  30 minutes to reject you and your 2 days of effort. Damn the day I chose this profession. I hate this job, it literally eats my soul every fucking day.
“Thank you so much for hopping on this call!”

“You’re welcome”
Actually you can use a KNN model to solve that
I would use git push -force or take the source files if they look correct to resolve the conflict.
lol
"mapahash put4 madre" 😂😂😂😂😂😂
YOU ARE AN IDIOT. The correct answer is "Use Hashmap with n^42 iterations of SHA 512 bit algorithm" 

42 is the significant number here. Geeks love it.
The breathing exercise 🤣
0:13 got me on the floor XD
Hash-man :)
I would use a Hashmap combines with a special deep cashing algorithm. Load Balancing would be implemented via Data Sharding and a new developed Data science techinque called multithreading.
The hell, dont understand but memorize it. Damn genius Joma
I think you overmeditated bro
nobody beats hashmap!
Pulled up lena and double lift lmao hilarious
"What would do if you had a conflict with your manag-"
"HASHMAP! I'D USE A HASHMAP!"
LOL
Dude still making money and its almost end of 2022. He is the prove we all can make it
Enorme Joma jaja
not me literally paying for all the courses on coursera for every little thing that the job position requires me to know.. there's no way i can finish them all on time
Im crying
✩˙
Mapa hash hi*j0 de p*t@
fuck this is amazing.
So Great!! 🤣🤣
Towards the end I guess that answer was incorrect? In my opinion the answer to that was to form a n-ary tree representing the hierarchical structure of the team, find the node with your name in it and delete that node coz you’re fucked 
Note: delete the node while also maintaining the correct hierarchical structure of other remaining nodes.
well, now tell me that's not a correct answer!
JAJAJAJA
why in spanish?
There are 2 types of problem solvers:
One who actually came up a solution
Others who use hash map.
I once smoked weed before the interview, they loved me because I literally unfolded web development for them as if they were kids
I failed this question many times. 😅
That’s every field 😂
Hashmap! I'll use a Hashmap!
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
What model is that ultrawide monitor in the thumbnail? Is it the same LG 48" one from the desk setup video?
As a spanish speaker, I would punch anyone who says "m a p a h a s h " irl
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣……… HashMap, I would use a HashMap; I almost died laughing.
Literally using the exact same resources for preping tech interviews, this says so much about SWE interviews in general, lol.
0:40 😂😂😂 Fuck love meditating
0:09 I always find myself opening Attack on titan Instead of Elements of programming interviews  :P
This is awesome one up on a time I used to make films…. I love this
Mapa hash puta madre haha
"HashMap! I will use a hashmap"
😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣
I wonder how you feel 5s after realising what you just said...
😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂
😂
Hash map is the best invention mankind have ever come up with
I'm currently interviewing with 10 companies. this is accurate.
🤣👍
No bothering, almost all hiring freezed
Man, I don't think you can hashmap that.
Hilarious 😂
一亩三分地 lol
The ending hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaahhaahahahahahahahah
fucking love meditating
Possibly your best work yet!
Python, C++ and Spanish 🙌 🙇
Hashmap, Puta madre
Breathing exercise in bathroom ?
How dare you look down on  Java. I do that for a living for the last 10 years. And googled all my answers. Lol
Man is spittin' straight facts
I like it!!! 😁
😂😂😂😂
That death note was all he needed
Hashmap! I'll use a hashmap! Damn, I laughed out.🤣
Aren’t there usually two types of interview? Interview with HR and user interview, which is more technical?
This was so good. Companies don’t really want geniuses but normal people who can work in and build a team to bring in results than going all Han Solo in a project.
42
😂😂😂
This is so on point. I'm doing my first practical C++ interview for a company in a few days and I'm so anxious I can't stop studying
Don't worry guys, the answer is always hashmap if you do not know it.
Came for the memes , got introduced to Grokking 😆🙌
This is too relatable. I remember over-preparing for every interview where I literally went through my entire degree again to make interview notes. I had a one scrawling word document of every algorithm + time complexities and data structure I ever learned, and then another one for every possible behavioural question and examples of conflicts and how I resolved them. 

Then they asked me where I see myself in 10 years and how much I want to be paid. Too good, love you Joma 😂
Yeah you are more active again. Thought i have to wait another 2 months for the next video
Ayo this is the best coding interview skit I have seen lol loved the reading the spanish version, "mapas hash puta madre" el programador mexicano promedio
Out of all these, the one thing that i actually do is stalk the interviewer's wife
0:57 fuckin hell, I've definitely done that a few times.
It always ends in an awkward silence.
kkkkkkkkk
The most important thing is to own the first 4 volumes of AOT and a volume of Death Note Black Edition :D
lol😂😂😂😂😂😂
damn that meditation joke was good
Hashmap can solve world hunger and global warming!
Imagine Steve He is the interviewer like in one of his video and he goes like” You again with the hash browns brain with hash hash potatoes all over your head”. 😂
Hmmm… Nice.
“Fucking love meditating”
I’m hollering 😂😂😂
I'll use one of the most ancient efficient data structures known to man... "hash-map-uh"
Is dsa worth learning?
I'm a self taught web dev and I was wondering if concepts in dsa can be applied to actual problems
Perfect
Breathing Exercise  ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Sorry but we didn’t find you to be a culture fit.
leena bruh
Check the wife 😂😂😂
The worst part is all that over preparation does little to nothing.
Hahaha "Mapa Hash, puta madre" was hilarious
id personally challenge my manager to a coding duel
Hahaha what a mystery there is with the hashmap
You're Chinese
🤣 hashmap best map
😂😂
accurate af
Being a Chinese has its advantages
Being a Chinese has its advantages
I love the fact that you used Doublelift and Leena as your interviewer and his wife 😂
Mr@Robot
You should update the url for your LinkedIn mock as well, now you've exposed Maria Lai
please we want full video on this topic
getting System Design ad by Educative all the time 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I did slap my knee. Well done.
This is so mee 😂😂
I will debug the relationship between me and my boss
Hashmap was exactly how my last interview failed. He asked me to figure out 2 missing numbers from a 1 to 100 unsorted array, in O(n). I told him a O(n.logn) answer but he insisted on optimizing. Despite doing 30-50 hashmap questions I couldn't recollect it at the time.
Hashmap is your SO till you get placed, you cultured programmers.
Hashmap motherfuckers 😂😂😂
Joma I like it
love the idea that doublelift is the one interviewing you
😂😂😂
Joma getting hired by doublelift? Shits about to get lit
хаха😁
The solution to corruption is a hashmap 😎
ahahha 😁
I am also waiting you vedios and  trying to  interview preparation
Are you, still working for a job ?
I have a tendency to have these extremely stupid moments when under pressure (which is every social interaction), and once they asked me how something would look in memory. I thought he meant how does it actually look. Like physically. Like you take a hard drive and how does it look on it. And I couldn't answer that, hell I don't think I could answer the actual question either. I just looked at the red hang up call button and wanted to click it. It was genuinely like 30 seconds of silence not even exaggerating. There were many many more stupid situations in that interview. I think when people say the "bombed the interview" they never truly did that, because usually there are some redeeming moments. This interview had literally none. It was the most humiliating experience of my life, and I spent many days since then questioning my life and where it's headed. It really sucks that I'm so bad and unmotivated to be better. I'm a games programmer, but I'm a gamer first, and a programmer second. It's not my hobby to study and become better. And it feels like those rockstar programmers actually do just enjoy the process of improving their skillset.
Thanks I think I am perfectly prepared for my Interview tomorrow :D
Mapa hash, p*tamadre hahahaha
lmao so true.
I didn't know the video has been finished, i was like wtf!, After Hashmap, I was waiting for more humor.
Mapa hash ✊
LOL..🤣😂 I laughed so hard... You funneh Man🤣
Love how “hashmap” is the solution to everything 😂
#Amazon interviews xD
It's a little known fact that conflicts with your manager are best solved using a stack. There you just pile up all your anger until you achieve stack overflow. And, as we all know, stack overflow solves all your problems ...
Conflict?!?? I would inspect the log and see in which commit the files were changed! THEN I'd aks ETHE DEVLeroproer Abolut it and conme to a rsefolution ona sepratbranch!!! *puts finger to lower lip* PLBLBLBLBLBL
ROFL! you just killed it xD
My dad asks if anybody can share instagram profile of "interviewer's wife"
the last response should've been "mapa hash puta madre"
Why not use garbage collection?
😂coolshell...it's kind of ridicule about chinese programmer, but it's so accurate
To be fair, HashMaps are the right answer more often than not.
I thought I was the only one who checks all of the social media pages of the recruiter
what's the first website
On call interviews are like surprise test 😂
I Would Call 911 ..and don't Think my Manager would Survive. 😅
So correct for me, do a ton of leet code and not pass the sceening becase of poor English
So all your viewers are also tech students or stuffs like that?  Bruh i don't even know how to laugh at their joke cuz I'm so confused
Lead software engineer here. I can confirm that a hashmap produces the fastest way to resolve a conflict but uses more memory compared to other solutions.
Loop
ah yes. breathing exercises
Accurate AF!
😂😂I will use hashmap
Bueno mi loco, hace un mapa hash puta madre 😈
Hmm, Nice!!
Please tell to your interviewer, I love his wife
Hey at least it's not as bad as the job application that demands 10 years of Carbon experience when that language was released in 19 July 22. Meaning the language is not even a years old.



(Note, please tell me these job applications are just memes lol. Like what kind of logic is behind this bullshit?)
Who is that wife ? 🙂
0:13 mapa hash puta madre
everytime Joma makes videos about coding, I always visit and watch
😂
Hajahahhahaha
😂😂😂😂😂 the spanish part LMAO
Bro hopped on the best time complexity solution . 😂😂
HAHAHAHAH the ending killed me
That was Too short i need MORE .
People should be hired based on their ability to find good answers on StackOverflow
l love joma's videos and they support me in my programming
Thanks, now I’ll do all of this nail next interview :)
"Go the bathroom for my breathing exercise" is so effing relatable!!
What display is it?
え ぇ、面接に準備すぎるあまりよくない
"so all of this just to hash-map"
deadly but simple ..... The hashmap
Mapa hash puta madre!! 🤣
mine was even worse, I studied a 4 years degree to pass the interview... what a waste of time, could have learned it all in 6 months...
I speak Spanish as a native language and had to re-watch 3 times de "P*ta madre" part to understand what you said, even with the subs 🤣🤣🤣🤣 Masterpiece! Thanks for making me laugh
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I taught only i faced such situation 🤣
You know you are a simple programmer when you need to take interviews.
😂😂😂
Hhhhhhh amazing
What would I do if I had a conflict with my manager? You expect me to remember all the times that happened, and what I did? What are you, some kind of manager?
😂😂 that was unexpected
😂😂😂😂😂 this one as  killed me.
"I love meditation"... 🤣
"If you had the chance to solve any problem in the world, which one would you solve and why"

"Where do you see yourself in 5 years"
Guess I have to SO that problem
I love hashmap. everybody love hashmap.
Lmao golden ending
O(1)
HASH MAP
I love this shit
Mapa hash puta madre JAJAJAJAJJJJ
Hashmap! 🤣🤣🤣
Hi Joma we need more!! post every week
Instantaneous answer😂
Oh this is why he needed someone who's solved 1000+ leetcode questions 😄
lmao.
So true. Thank you joma
hashmap solves almost everything :)
Funny and true
naah..i ll just use binary search on no. of conflicts
Are accountants also tested in interviews the google style?
😂😂😂😂😂
At the end of the day hash map is the answer to everything in universe Not 42.
I love your meditation techniques Joma.

What is the minimum "time" that you should meditate?
Hashmap 🤣🤣🤣
i expected the interviewer to be doublelift cause the wife was lena
YO this is funny! But damn overpreparing is like "chill bro you're not gonna work at a nuclear powerplant" :)))
Totally me 🤣
read attack on titan for extra motivation
Oh, you'd use a HashMap!? Right, let me just check my notes here.  Uhhhh,... that's absolutely correct!
Hahaha
"You're welcome" Lmao
Have to memorise every panel of Attack on titan thats on my shelf
Breathing exercises 📝
"How to resolve a conflict? Easy, I just click "Use ours" on every change"
good job)
Hashmap 😂
Easy I'll use 2 pointers
The answer to everything : Hashmap

No the answers is you reverse a linked list 🤣🤣🤣
Those “Behavioral questions” can be as challenging as the technical ones …
You guys prepare for interviews?

Man i am dead 🤣😅😂
hashmap mf....
My day will be made if Joma pins this comment :3

Literally me😂
This is like me studying maths xd
Dont know what but memorizing
what is the name of the website with the list of the problems ? (n-queens etc.)

Lol
Elements of programming interviews right between death note and attack on titan, nice
I laughed out loud 😂😂😂
As an engineer I can confirm this story.
ahahahhaha 🤣🤣🤣
Wait, I'm supposed to prepare for job interviews?
The dude just prepared for a technical one instead of an HR interview 😒
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂

Pure genious! Love it!
I need to start meditation.
Breathing excerise is a MUST!
HAhaha
Technically Hashmap == DuctTape
Fuckin luv meditating hahaha
Haha
Great video! Is the length tethered to the price of Solana? 🙃
this says a lot about society
0:11 Python? .....I'm a self taught Python programmer( it's easiest way for me to learn basic programming ), why would they want a slow program intended for children, other than Scratch?....is it because this is a comedy video?....ok then I understand
These are the videos I loved and still love from you 😄😄
You're one of the worst vloggers in the programming world.
Pleaseee i need more of this 😂
Last word has laugh until I almost lose my mind.
why are you so funny?? ahah I literally laugh every 5 seconds
ending was hilarious, please do one for behavioural interviews
I am going to have an interview tomorrow. I was pretty stressed. This cracked me up =D
Hashmap is the solution to all life problems 😂
I would use a hashmap haha the way you answered was real funny! 🤣🔥
[ANYTHING happens] Hashmap! I'll use a Hashmap!
Hash the conflict
finds its index in the bucket list
Return the resolution
Mandem genius!
Distributed delivery network, next question.
Hashmap!!!!!😂
This was a great video lmao 😂😂😂😂😂
God bless you bro!! Regards from Russia ;)
HAHAHAHA TOLOL
Cool to see "Elements of programming" between Shingeki (AoT) and Death Note
Mapa hash pota madre c:
I am a visual designer ...so I will use photoshop to resolve the conflict
Hahahaha the hashmap never fails 😂
Mann .. this was hilarious when he yelled Hashmap😂😂
Same situation but still can't get any job😭😭😭😭
My older brother recently had gotten an interview with google and had been studying for a full week prior to the day. He went to just about every video regarding questions, topped off his coding for review and studied websites revolving around the topic. However the interviewer seemed very vague and uninterested as I assumed they had about 100 others in the waiting list and couldn’t care for any particular person… My brother answered all his questions correctly and confidently as far as I know. I know all this because the meeting was held virtually and I was standing near his office overhearing the conversation.
So the answer is Hashmap, you make my day 🐧
LOL! 🤣🤣🤣🤣 Loving it!!!
Checked his wife 😂😂
This is so funny lol. Tech companies should stop asking these weird convoluted questions to people with more than 3 years experience. If a person have more than 3 years of expereince and have done projects and have a good reference then questions should not be neccessary.
Mapa mash puta madre XD
Trick question, I would never have a conflict w/ my manager 😇. Only happy little accidents. And by accidents I mean accidents, ain't gonna get caught slippin.
"fckn love meditating" :D:D:D sure you do
Hashmap puta madre 😏
The answer was binary search 🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️
Binary lift the centroid decomposition to achieve sub-constant search space.
Big brother JOMA thanks for  suggesting resources for my interview prep😂😂.
We all voted for that dating video. Please make it joma.
Still staring at the screen waiting for the punchline
my boy knows who doublelift is
I love meditating with icing sugar, too.
Hahahahaa checked her wifeeee
Don't bother yourself preparing for the interviews. Why?  
- Well now with "Tech hiring freze" nobody hires coders, didn't get the memo, it is recesion/ downhill / inflation..bad times
- There is only demand for for senior highly specialised fields, junior positions are oversaturated
- What you see on indeed are positions from recruters, that post 5 times to 10 times the posts for 1 real position 
- I don't know if you heard, but they do remote jobs/ outsource positions to poor countries/third world countries
- Copmetition is insane.. and seriously if you have a low IQ you will have a bad time working with abstraction every single day

I could continue, but it doesn't look good for the Tech sector, proabley you will waste your time, the competition is insane.. and the pay is medium. You will be better off you you get in a Trade sucha as a plumper/ electrician/ welder/ carpenter/ etc...
if you ever feel like having some companion sometime, I'm down for an hour of 2 of methitation every weekend :)
lol
Can some1 explain the joke at the last part?
lololol didn’t understand the hash map in spanish at first, but loved it anyways
Joma you're the best
haha you are so funny  just to add when you said "putamadre" that doesnt mean motherfucker im not sure how to translate "putamadre" to english but motherfucker in spanish is "hijo de puta" that means that you are son of a wore but saying "putamadre" is a word commonly used when you fail at somenthing or you are astonishsed by somenthing or in a euphoric moment its like saying "god damn " or "holy shit" altough "puta " is whore and "madre" is mother but "putamadre" doesnt mean motherfucker
Hashmap
Meanwhile, idiot sandwich me in an interview:

Recruiter: Why did you apply for this position, and why did you choose our company?
Me: Actually I'm applying for all open positions, not unique to your company tho...

(they didn't even send me a rejection mail haha)
Man, last thing hurted me so hard, now I am at Hospital
This is so good 😂😂
0:09 Attack on Titan and death note, manga, how could you even pick a coding book lying between those two manga
Hashmap putamadree
hashmap
like for hashmap!!!
The funniest comlanies are the small ones with low salaries and with high standarts.
That's a lot of things in an one minute video!
HAHAHA
just preparing and so relatable😂
HashMap will solve a conflict with manager for sure. 🤣
With interviews going virtual these days, I've never felt this offended, lmao. I do prepare, quite a lot.
I never prepare. Hence I am still unemployed. :')
Lmao, I did this back when I started my first tech job as a software engineer after schooling. I study languages relevant for the jobs on my country and lots of other preparation while waiting for the hiring process which took like 4 months. It was a big company so I was expecting the tech to be really deep work. I was surprised it was Oracle Cloud. Lmao
"Elements of Programming Interviews" is wedged between Attack On Titan and Death Note?
Oh, that's how you cheat. I need to order two monitors.
Failed a dozen technical interviews, confirmed, interviewers cum when you say hash map….
Don't skip BQ, lol.
0:18 look at the bottom monitor, 1513 leetcode problems, huh?😂😂
'hashmap' part really got me🤣
Where can i find the same specs the interviewer was wearing, or its name
It's really impressive how u filmed everything yourself on a tripod
LMAO THIS IS SO TRUE🤣🤣🤣
"What would you do if your potential employer didn't own a Patagonia jumper?"
using a hashmap definitely works, for each problem there's a solution
hhhhhhh nmb xswl
True. Hashmap works everywhere
Oh.That's why I had conflicts with him, I didn't use hashmap
0:04 :- Joma, when you solve 1500+ problems on Leetcode. Your rank can't be 175k. It's gotta be under 5k bro.
it’s so funny 😁…i wish i can click like button 1 million times on this video
0:08 Spanish..lol
putamadre
Really Interesting want see whats next 😕 .. 👌👌 

You are Awesome... 😊
Doublelift's insta lol
What is this - Hashmap 
I don't know 🤔
mapa hash puta madre
Good old Joma always makes me laugh,,,
"I fucking love meditating"

Damn, that got me a lot better than I thought it would
Please don’t encourage cheatsheets. Unfair to those who aren’t using them. Don’t cheat.
Please make videos on interview preparation please 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
Lmao
Breathing exercise 😂😂
Oh my... ROFLMAO... This shiz amazing bruh! Want to what this on while loop. Using circular linked list. Puta madre!
print hello world may be
The Spanish bit got me lol. It was so perfectly timed. Mapa de Hash putamadre.
Bro, what are the sketchy Chinese websites with leaked interview questions? Asking for a friend
Check their wife????
Hmm seems a great idea. A wife might reflect recruiter's mind 😶.
Broo, "so I go into the bathroom for some breathing exercises.." too funny, man.
Hashmap is wrong, if you have a conflict with your manager, bring up your DNS and redirect the traffic.
What will you do if you fight with your manager😡? for loop😱 , in recursive way hhhhhh🤣
He asks different thing though
on point man! this made my day LOL!
LMAO love this
The answer is always a hash map
Things to add to the list of things I already do :
1. Breathing Exercise
2. Sketchy Chinese Website
My day will be made if Joma pins this comment :3
stalking the interviewer part is so true 😁
0:28 easter egg? future collab with Leena?
AJAJJAAJ sos un crack Joma! Me hacer reír mucho con tus ocurrencias... Saludos desde Argentina!
Hahaha. Cant stop laughing… this is epic
No wonder all my interviewees are uncomfortable,I only ask emotional based questions.
“Hey, thank you so much for hopping on this call” 
“You’re welcome” 
lmfao I nearly died at this 😂
Lol is that my boi doublelift
The meditation part is... OMG
what the next of this video ? 😂
doublelift's ig XD...
That's a treasure.
make it realistic moj
Great boss 😂😂😂😂
Imma download that book
girl from the photo is @leena_xu :p
nice leena xu
however, this video has a lot of facts I did not know before.
woman in cs here! was laughing until we had to make a joke about sexualizing women. but yknow… guess it wouldn’t be a funny cs video unless we objectified women in it. bummer. At least u remembered to use a hashmap! :’D
항상 느끼는건데. 조마조마~~하다
every day
That is why u asked for the 1000 solved leet codes screenshot?
Lol I’m now embarrassed at how much I love a hash map
My day will be made if Joma likes this Comment <3
ohhhhh that's why you are looking for 1000+ solved leetcode problems in instagram hahahahaha
The answer is always hashmap! #hired (binary search is a close second)
lol
I just interview at a fuckload of jobs and find one that doesn't ask leet code then ask for way above their payrate. Its worked 100% of the time
Meditation is really important 😂😂
JAJAJAJ im spanish i liked that accent but its terrifying (like my one :)  )
hashmap😂😂
Actually all those student prep for interview. We all can relate to joma content. Love it @Joma ❤️ and bcuz of the content I feel more energetic to learn hashmaps 😂😂
Wait, which sketchy Chinese websites am I missing out on?
我看到一亩三分地这个网站的时候真是……lmfao
One day when I m in NYC i will definitely meet him
Oh 
So that’s why you were asking for that leetcode screenshot on Instagram the other day lol 😂
"You're welcome." 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Wait ur allowed cheatsheats for coding interview? Wtf am I studying at a schizo level for
man that was awesome
I need to greet them with "You're welcome" just to see how that goes.
wwkwkw so relate with me
Lmao this is quite accurate
Is that Doublelift's instagram? WTF
Lmao
Dude, that was hilarious! I'm so respectful and thankful for your ability to work hard and make us laugh, especially with what you have been going through. It's funny, we work at such advanced job solving complex problems with minimal cost, why can't we just find a way (a "high tech" way if you will) to tackle the divorce courts and the immense hatred towards men?
lmao can relate
Superb 👍
Of course, Python, C++ and Spanish, I failed because I forgot the Spanish :(
As a native spanish speaker, mapahashputamadre got me unprepared
You might want to blur out your credit card numbers :(
Just you to make me laugh after another negative Interview
I have 2 solutions to this problem. The first one is 1D DP where I memorize every single mistakes that my manager has ever made and store them in a hashmap while use date as a key to lookup. The second one is greedy algorithm where I fight my manager inch by inch and win every single arguments we have to destroy him. They both have a time complexity of O(n), but the greedy one uses constant memory only, so it’s better. Now let’s run some test cases. You (interviewer) can be my manager and we can start a conflict here.
I expected, ‘how do you code “Hello, world!”’..
It was the breathing exercise for me
一亩三分地 lmao
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I’m sorry that’s not the optimum solution please apply again next year
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
My day will be made if Joma pins this comment :3
一亩三分地 lmao
I was doing an interview for an flutter position, the guy saw in my CV that i have 6 months of Unreal Engine and started asking question about it, still landed on the flutter job even tho he just ask me about unreal
Going to bathroom for meditation
Hashmap... that was expected approved
Hashmap... that was expected approved
Hashmap🤣🤣🤣 even though I don't understand what hashmap means
Joma you are genuios  in this stuff  assume 😂👍❤
As a spanish speaker, that "Mapa hash, p*ta madre" is really accurate.
That job will be yours, Joma! 👍🏾
The 'your welcome' is the best, most insightful part of this interview.
That this video was 1:09 and not some 18 minute video with a stupid open mouth selfie pasted in the thumbnail I had to watch it.
Better overprep than underprep 😅
Most of silicon valley is meditating the same exact way
That breathing exercise tho lamo
everything happened soo fast, all i remembered was when he said puta madre
I finally got a Software Engineering job last month. I was surprised that I flubbed a lot of the language-specific technical questions and still got the job. They said they "liked the way I think."
Yesss joma tech videos. Best 1minute + video.
sketchy chinese website hhhhhh
so funny bro
bro! post more. I love when u do. It's so enjoyable.
I did check their wives/gfs if necessary.
our old joma back 🥰😍🤩😘
Let's be honest, hashtables and hashmaps work every time
😂😂😂 que se supone que fue lo que dijiste en español???  No se entendió nada😂
Love Joma ❤️💯Always relatable to  current life scenarios ✨💖
🤣🤣🤣🤣😂🤣😂
Hash Map is indeed powerful
Doublelift lol
哈哈哈
牛逼
Hire me 😏!!!
I would use git diff to help me see the differences that causes the conflict with the manager branch, then manually go through each of them and resolve them
So pin it! Do it! Hashmap!
Hashmap 😅😅
once there is a conflict with my manager and i tried to solve it with hash map, it doesnt work, the problem is not resolved and i was placed to PIP, this video is misleading!!!!!
grokking the system design interview be like: use the 80/20 rule and least recently used algo to cache results, put a load balancer on everything, and have duplicates of all your servers and data
LOVE THIS!! Comedic short Videos are the best 😘😘
Mapa hash, puta madre.
lol, i will use a hashmap🤣
01:07: he's right, especially if the manager is not technical. 
It's best to confuse them permanently to avoid conflict, just like HashMap.
literally me, and still no job. haha...
Hash map is the answer to all interview questions
Aight, this got me to tip again
哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈啊哈哈
0:18 Just have 194 problems bro :))
So Hashmap is the universal solution. I See.... Good
didn't expect you to know 1p3a
Oh, nice i need to do the breathing exercise for my exams :)
i accidentally played it at 1.5 speed and it was even better
what would you do if your food isn't hot?
- I'll reload vscode
Lol.
I haven't met one person that over prepares... People always have to go through multiple tech assessments and suffer a lot, buying an interview prep course doesn't solve the problem
You’re the best 😂😂😂😂
I love Jomas vids
On serious note,  it is easy to resolve conflicts 

Just use "hashmap Motherfucker"
(In Spanish)
ahahhahahahhahahah
one of the funniest videos I've ever seen , so relatable
0:28 - that's how you know your interviewer is a liar, use it to your advantage
😂😂
LMAOOOO this reminds me of an interview I did when I was super Junior, and they asked a behavioural question like "how would you handle a non'-technical dispute with a co-worker" and I didn't actually process that it wasn't technical so I said well if my code is more optimal than his/hers then the correct choice would be to go with my program since everything i write is in constant time.
I'm commenting because there are resources that I didn't know about that I'll definitely check out... Lol
bring all the cheatsheet only work if u have big ass monitor
Me rn preparing for an interview next week
was waiting for these type of content
LMAOOOOOAOAOAO
best joke ever made my day even made my whole year
Torn to shreds 🤣
Leena Xu btw
LOL! Your jokes is literally refreshing! 🤣
jajajaj puta madre dice XD, me dio mucha risa es parte del video, nice videos
ㅋㅋㅋㅋlol
Joma is back! That's not spanish hahaha
👍🏻😂😂
"breathing exorcise"
i'd probably have used kdiff
TIL Maria Lai = Peter Huang
😂
The answer is ALWAYS hashmap!
My day will be rocking if Joma The Legend pins this comment 🙃
That line, " Breathing excercise" 😂
🤣🤣
04:46 💀💀💀💀not sure that's how u meditate
Can you be a software engineer if you suck at math
so humble )
面试造火箭，入职拧螺丝。

Interview: How to make a rocket?
Actual work: How to screw a screw?
0:15 In Spanish, motherfucker = "hijo de puta", not "puta madre".
Lol awesome！！
do you know how we pronounce hashmap in Spanish? Jachmap.
xDDD
What is the top LG. Monitor?
1 point 3 acres lmao
Anyone else here needing to stop the video every now and then to keep up with the jokes? 😭😂
how is 1acre3points a sketchy website lol
At 0:40 "I go to the bathroom to get my breathing excercise."


PAUSE


WHAT THE FU...?! ☠☠☠☠☠☠☠☠☠☠☠☠☠☠
😂😂😂🤣🤣 one of ur best yet
Honestly, I felt like I didn't study nearly enough for my FAANG interview, turned out that most of the questions were design focused and soft skill/past experience questions.
The meditation part seems more sketchy
Joma that ending🤣
Masterpiece.
What a hashmap! Haha
"mapa hash, Puta madre" never fails
Mapa hash puta madre!!!! XD
p-uta madre :O
it sucks we got to study for an interview instead of the real job
The inner monologue is like from Mr Robot
Oh my god. I laughed so much!! HasMap!!
run *$ rm -rf /* on the manager
That's a dusty laptop. I thought for a moment that the finger print were on my own screen rather than yours. 😂🤣
Stop doing your breathing exercices- it's not good for you :(
Amazing video lmao
LMAO 0:27 that doublelift instagram & that lady is TSM Leena...
I like this short video
😂😂😂😂😂😂
This makes me wonder just how widespread "meditating" really is in tech
Why is this so oddly accurate
that bathroom meditation I be on that on  a regular
Whats that chinese website?
x,D thats not spanish ahahahahahahah
For my interview, I studied how to invert binary trees
That Spanish bit is just pure comedy 😂
Mapa Hash puta madre, grande Joma.
if you don't know the answer, use hashmaps 🤷🏻‍♂️🤣
LMFAOOOOO
LOLOLOL
Mapa hash puta madre jajaja perfect!
Never gets old
I would invert his binary tree.
Great stuff haha
1:07 "Fork bomb! Fork bomb! I'd use a fork bomb!" Lol
Guess you should have grokked those amazon leadership questions too lol
My brain telling me to immediately click the video, shows how much your videos quality has increased in the last couple years.
"I go to the bathroom for my breathing exercises"
*SNORT*
Interviewer: Tell me something not in your resume.
*play video*
Oh f**k, it's me
lol was that doublelift and leena? 😂
Great, great and great video!
just get on breathing exercise and meditation after watching boss's wife
0:14 i'm spanish... No understand :(
I love this, thank you Joma Tech.
😂😂😂
Totally nailed it !
0:57 i legit choked on my food
I don’t even program but this was soo funny
"your welcome" 🤣
fucking love meditating
Don't be telling them smart HR people to remove questions from Glassdoor now 🙄
just throw a hashmap at it bro
Hashmap was the fucking bomb 😂
Brilliant!
Somehow he made Spanish sound like mandarin
I jost lost it at the spanish part
hahahahaa
LMAO my man went on Leena's instagram 😂
Get membership of 一亩三分地，and accumulate 大米
You forgot to mention your Big O Conflict Notation, would not hire
I laughed so baaadly hahaha🤣🤣
I prepared myself just like the video, and recently in an interview got an unexpected question: take a paper and a pen, draw a person. ?? yeah that's was it.
HAHAHAHA
Killer Vid
The hiring process is broken
“Fucking love meditating” ☠️☠️☠️☠️
I lost at breathing exercise 💀 I laugh so hard
Hashmap is always the correct answer!
and thats all? weve been waiting for year ....
Whoever's reading this, i pray that whatever you're going through gets better and whatever you're struggling with or worrying about is going to be fine and that everyone has a fantastic day! Amen
Whoever's reading this, i pray that whatever you're going through gets better and whatever you're struggling with or worrying about is going to be fine and that everyone has a fantastic day! Amen
😂🤣
Interviewer opens with: "What experience do you have with flash animations?"
The video I should've watched 2 weeks ago, but I didn't. Otherwise I'd be a time traveler.
LOL
Joma really used Leena xu as his wife lmao!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Interviewer: thanks for hoppin on this call.
Joma: your welcome.
Interviewer: 😐
'in spanish' 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Hash map is actually the correct answer
hashmap lmfao
Jajajja Breathing exercise jjajaja
0:38 一亩三分地 hhhh
One of the funniest videos u ever made . Awesome buddy
AHahhahahah the final punch was really funny
HASHMAP SOLVES EVERYTHING LOL
mr.robot vibes i love it!
macbook looking dusty
The "You Welcome" Got me dead 🤣
😂😂 This exactly how it be
Did you knew that there actually couldn''t be conflict with employer and manager if they are professionals. Conflict it is strategy because of ...
if you get stuck just use a hashmap
Joma's short videos are much funnier than those long ones.
The stalking the interviewer…I…I have definitely not done that…maybe
If you ever get stuck just throw in a hashmap
🤣🤣🤣haa this is like one minute of comedy 😅😂😂 ..the way he said hashmap 😂😂😂
Hahahaha!
LOL breathing exercises hahahah I was expecting something else xD
We all need to know the name of this sketchy Chinese website! No I already tried hashmao!
🤣
kekw :D
lol what was that chinese website
0:38 I’m kinda surprised you know this too
Nice, now let's see Paul Allen's excellent youtube video
i can see myself doing this in the future :)
Nice...
I also love meditating, I do it pretty frequently at my job
Joma scam
Fuckin love meditating…bruh 😂
Ah yes, Doublelift did the classic LCS pro to SWE switch ;)
i too.. would use a hashmap
Got some interviews coming up and this came at just the right time. You made my day!
a man of culture, meditate on
Ahaahhaha, these interview takes are massively too real for some of us bro 😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣. Nailed it!
This literally made my day hahahhaha
You make me laugh every time! Soooo relatable!!!!
Looking at Doublelift's instagram lol
JAJAJAJAJAJ "mapa hash puta madre" ¿Por qué la violencia hermano? 😂😂
Mapa Hash Pu*** Madre jajajajajajaja sorry I mean hahahahahah
I saw death note
Seems so true!!
It had me laughing like crazy and thanks for the amazing video Joma.
I feel attacked lol
The spanish was MVP of this video.
"Mapa hash, puta madre" xDDD 10/10
Very Accurate😂
Always hashmap lmao
what is the name of that website (programming problems) @ 0:02 
Please & Thank you <3
In Actuality: Now that you've proven that you had to acquire a maths degree on the side to your CS degree shown that you know all programming patterns by name and by heart and proven to us that you are potentially compatible with the team and answered some absurd question we stole from google interviews we're fairly confident that you can infact color by numbers.
"fucking love meditating" going to steal that clip lmao
The Fack man!! Haha the End!
or you get fizzbuzz kinda questions
I loved your content the first day I viewed it.
bruh, isnt that the girlfriend from Doublelift ? 😂😂
mapa hash, puta madre! 😎
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 dead on
Took a break from my interview prep to watch this 😂
My day will be made if Joma pins this comment :3
💯%
Joma Tech stop exposing us, hahahahaha
whose IG is that???????
a) and how would you iterate this hashmap ? b) (without using the letters "skunk") ?
I've been working on some code to replace my manager for five years now. Hopefully, that's the right answer :).
The hash map comment absolutely KILLED me hahahaha
El video estar muy bien amigo
.
Lol
hahahahahahaha so funny, ur welcome
I actually had a similar experience to this.

Software engineer manager: What went poorly in your last team, and what will you do on your current team to ensure that things happen differently?
Me: Oh f***, I didn't study for this!
me now hahahaha
Bro
excellent :D
Is that doublelift insta lol
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Mapa hash
Hashmap is the programming world's equivalent to 42
If that Facebook profile were my manager, I would have used a doubly-linked list.
"if you ever get stuck, just throw a hashmap at the problem"
Mapa Hash, puta madre 😂😂👌
👽😍😍😍😍🎥
HAHAHAHAHAHA
I feel so called out, this video popped up while I was doing interview prep and I felt like I was looking in the mirror lol
that's why you asked on instagram for a profile with over 1000 leetcode problems
what is the website with problems?
Super relatable !! I prepared like this for an interview which I thought will be purely technical but they ended up asking “ What makes you get up everyday from bed” 😂😂
The old good joma
Loooool this guy would for sure make a good comedy feature film one day… hashmap didn’t disappoint me! 😂
i too love meditating
LOL! my first job interview as a frontender, I studied all Vue, React and Angular, but the only thing they wanted me to do was to flex a red div from left to right. only needed html and css which arent really programming languages 😂
Hashmap! Always works
Omg finally a peogramming video thank u so much
We need continuation of Eric Wang series 🥲
hashmap is the key
Elements of Programming Interviews is my favorite manga lol
Seems legit
All this only to center a div
BUT WTF IS A HASH????
The kind of video you can only make once you leave tech. Take notes lol 🤐
A legend once said: if u dont know anything say hashmap.
"you're welcome!" Lmao
PLEASE KEEP MAKING VIDEOS LIKE LMAOOO I LOVE IT
What's the chinese website called?
I lost it at "I fucking love meditating", that was even better than the final punchline ahah
it would be more appropriate to use HashSet
More like eat some hashbrowns
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I would personally use a binary tree, invert it 21 times. Then on assembly use the EAX register to cmp to the EDX register to resolve the conflict.
hes not wrong about dealing with a manager
Beside the jokes, most of the Software engineers does a lot of researches and read data structure learn pattern just for the interrview. When it comes then applying those rules in the job "StackOvverFlow"" comes to game.
HASHMAP!
Wow, I can’t express how true this really is.
"Fucking love meditating."
That got me rolling on the floor.
Dont lie, you solved 194 only, 0:02, watch at slomo!!
good old hashmap, nothing beats it
Hahaha was great!! 😂🤣😂🤣
We regret to inform you that we will not be moving forward with your application...
hashmap
why hashmap.... why you so obsessed.
